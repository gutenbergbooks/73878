  <h2 class='c001'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1862 the Committee of the Nightingale Fund,
with a view to extending the advantages of their Training
Institution, entered into an arrangement with the authorities
of St. John’s House, under which wards were fitted up in
the new part of King’s College Hospital, opening out of the
great staircase and shut up within their own doors, for the
reception of Midwifery cases. The wards were under the
charge of the (then) Lady Superintendent. Arrangements
were made for medical attendance, a skilled midwife was
engaged, a certain number of pupil nurses were admitted
for training; and hopes were entertained that this new
branch of our Training School would confer a great benefit
on the poor, especially in country districts, where trained
Midwifery nurses are needed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every precaution had apparently been taken to render
the Midwifery Department perfectly safe; and it was not
until the school had been upwards of five years in existence,
that the attention of the Nightingale Committee was called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>to the fact that deaths from puerperal diseases had taken
place in each of the preceding years.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the period of nearly six years that the wards were
in use, the records show that 780 women had been delivered
in the institution, and that out of this number twenty-six<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
had died—a mortality of 33·3 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most fatal year was 1867, in which year nine out of
the twenty-six deaths took place. In the month of January
a pregnant woman, who was under treatment for erysipelas
in the hospital, was delivered in a general medical ward,
No. 4, in the first-built wing of the hospital. A midwife
was told off to attend her, who was not suffered to be near
the midwifery wards for a considerable time. The erysipelas
case died of puerperal fever; and this death was followed by
a succession of puerperal deaths in the lying-in wards until
November, when the wards were as soon as possible closed.</p>

<p class='c007'>An analysis of the causes of death showed that, with the
exception of one death from hæmorrhage, not a single
death had taken place from accidents incidental to childbearing
during the whole six years. There were three
deaths due to diseases not necessarily concomitants of this
condition; while of the others, twenty-three in number, no
fewer than seventeen were due to puerperal fever, three to
puerperal peritonitis, two to pyæmia, and one to metritis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under these deplorable circumstances the closing of the
wards was a matter of course; and since that event we
have been anxiously enquiring whether it would be justifiable
to re-open our Midwifery Nursing School under other
conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>This question is discussed in the following pages, from a
basis of statistical facts supplied by the best authorities;
and a few proposals have been added, with the view of
turning to the best account our past experience, by extracting
from it any leading principles which may present themselves
for practical application in the future construction and
management of Lying-in Institutions, and more especially
in connection with means of training Midwifery nurses.</p>

<p class='c007'>These Introductory Notes, collected and put together
under circumstances of all but overwhelming business and
illness, are now thrown out merely as a nucleus, in the hope
that others will be kind enough to supplement, to add, and
to alter; in fact, only as a hook with a modest little fish on
it—a bait to catch other and finer fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts themselves, the nucleus, have been made as
correct as it was possible, and as would have been done for
a finished work. But the facts themselves are only put
forth as feelers—feelers to feel my own way.</p>

<p class='c007'>I need scarcely say either that these ‘Notes’ are not at all
meant to discuss every point which presents itself in Midwifery
statistics. On the contrary, they are, for the moment,
purposely limited to the consideration of facts immediately
relating to the present object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me thank once more with true gratitude all those
who have so kindly supplied me with help and information,
some of whose names will appear in the following pages.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>NOTES <span class='small'>ON</span> LYING-IN INSTITUTIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The first step to be taken in the discussion is to enquire,
What is the real normal death-rate of lying-in women? And,
having ascertained this to the extent which existing data
may enable us to do, we must compare this death-rate with
the rates occurring in establishments into which parturition
cases are received in numbers. We have then to classify
the causes of death, so far as we can, from the data, with the
view of ascertaining whether any particular cause of death
predominates in lying-in institutions; and, if so, why so?
And finally, seeing that everybody must be born, that
every birth in civilised countries is as a rule attended by
somebody, and ought to be by a skilled attendant; since,
therefore, the attendance upon lying-in women is the widest
practice in the world, and these attendants should be trained;
we must decide the great question as to whether a training school
for midwifery nurses can be safely conducted in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>building receiving a number of parturition cases, or whether
such nurses must be only trained at the bedside in the patient’s
own home, with far more difficulty and far less chance of
success.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c001'><i>MIDWIFERY STATISTICS.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It must be admitted, at the very outset of this enquiry,
that midwifery statistics are in an unsatisfactory condition.
To say the least of it, there has been as much discussion regarding
mortality and its causes among lying-in women as
there has been regarding the mortality due to hospitals.
Yet there appears to have been no uniform system of record
of deaths, or of the causes of death, in many institutions,
and no common agreement as to the period after delivery
within which deaths should be counted as due to the puerperal
condition. Many of the most important institutions
in Europe merely record the deaths occurring during the
period women are in hospital, and they appear not unfrequently
to do this without any reference to the causes.
Similar defects are obvious enough in the records of home
deliveries; and hence it follows that the mass of statistics
which have been accumulated regarding home and hospital
deliveries, admit of comparison only in one element, namely,
the total deaths to total deliveries, and this only approximately.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Matthews Duncan, in his recent work on the ‘Mortality
of Childbed and Maternity Hospitals,’ has dwelt forcibly on
these defects in midwifery statistics, and has made out a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>strong case for improvement in records. But, as will be
afterwards shown, with all their defects, midwifery statistics
point to one truth; namely, that there is a large amount of
preventible mortality in midwifery practice, and that, as a
general rule, the mortality is far, far greater in lying-in hospitals
than among women lying-in at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several of what may be called secondary influences
also, which must affect to a certain extent the
results of comparison of death-rates among different groups
of lying-in cases. Such are the ages of women, the number
of the pregnancy, the duration of labour, and the like.
It is impossible, in the present state of our information, to
attribute to each, or all of these, their due influence; neither,
if we could do so, would it materially affect the general
result just stated. But it is otherwise with another class of
conditions, of which statistics take no cognizance. Such
are the general sanitary state of hospitals, wards, houses,
and rooms where deliveries take place; the management
adopted; the classes of patients; their state of health
and stamina before delivery; the time they are kept in midwifery
wards before and after delivery. These elements
are directly connected with the questions at issue, and yet
our information regarding them is by no means so full as
we could wish—indeed is almost nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our only resource at present is to deal with such statistical
information as we possess, and to ascertain fairly what
it tells us. This we shall now endeavour to do, beginning
with an estimate of the normal mortality due to childbirth
in various European countries.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'><i>NORMAL DEATH-RATE OF LYING-IN WOMEN IN ENGLAND.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In the Registrar-General’s Thirtieth Annual Report, 1867,
there is an instructive series of tables, giving approximately
the present normal death-rate among lying-in women in
England.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of these tables (abstracted on Table I.) shows that,
including deliveries in lying-in hospitals, there were in
England, during the year 1867, 768,349 births, and that
3,933 women died in childbed. This gives an approximate
total mortality of 5·1 per 1,000 from all causes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The causes of mortality are also given in Table I. as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. There were 2,346 deaths by accidents of childbirth
(hæmorrhage, convulsions, exhaustion, mania, &#38;c.).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. There were 1,066 deaths due to puerperal diseases
(puerperal fever, puerperal peritonitis, metritis, pyæemia, &#38;c.).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Of the remaining 521 deaths, 137 were due to non-puerperal
fevers and eruptive fevers; 230 were occasioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>by consumption and other chest diseases, and 154 by other
causes.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. By adding together deaths from puerperal diseases and
those from fevers, we find that, out of a total mortality of
3,933, the deaths from diseases more or less connected with
what is called ‘blood-poisoning’ amounted to 1,203, or
rather more than 30 per cent. of the total mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. The mortality per 1,000 deliveries (or rather per 1,000

<p class='c007'>These facts, with a small deduction for the higher death-rates
in lying-in hospitals, give the present mortality in
English homes. They appear to show that puerperal women
are subject to something of the same law of increase of death-rates
in towns as other people, but part of the increase is no
doubt due to the higher death-rates in delivery wards in these
towns. The facts also appear to indicate a probable reduction
of death-rates among lying-in women in England, from
the extension of public health improvements both in town
and country.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'><i>NORMAL MORTALITY AMONG LYING-IN WOMEN IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next step in the enquiry is to ascertain, so far as it
may be possible to do so, what is the death-rate among
lying-in women delivered at their own homes in different
European countries. Besides the mortality statistics for
healthy districts in England, already given, the only available
data for this information are reports of public institutes
having outdoor midwifery practice, and any records of private
practice which may have been published. In adducing
these data, however, it is necessary to do so with the reservation
already made that their accuracy is only approximate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most extensive series of data of this class is given by
Dr. Le Fort in his able treatise ‘Des Maternités,’ for a number
of institutions in different European countries. The
facts from Dr. Le Fort’s book are abstracted on Table III., in
which it is shown that out of 934,781 deliveries at home,
in Edinburgh, London, Paris, Leipzig, Berlin, Munich,
Greifswald, Stettin, and St. Petersburg, there were 4,405
deaths, equivalent to a mortality of 4·7 per 1,000. When
compared with the Registrar-General’s returns for town
districts, this rate is apparently somewhat too low; it is
only an approximation, but still sufficiently near the rate
given by the Registrar-General to show that there is a true
death-rate for home deliveries not far removed from the
Registrar-General’s figure.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>St. George’s Hospital Statistics for ‘the 6 years preceding
1870 show only one maternal death in every 305 cases’ in
the Out-door Maternity Department.</p>

<p class='c007'>From home records, it is hoped at some future time to
give many more data of this kind, and to distinguish the
causes of death: puerperal from non-puerperal mortality, as
well as that caused by puerperal diseases from that caused by
accidents of childbirth. At present the data for doing this
are lamentably deficient, if not almost altogether wanting.</p>

<p class='c007'>One good recorded fact will here be given. Among
1,929 mothers delivered at home by Guy’s Hospital in
1869, 5 deaths only are recorded, and none from puerperal
diseases; 2 were from heart disease, 2 from pneumonia,
1 from exhaustion.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c001'><i>OBJECTIONS TO THE DATA.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The value of the Registrar-General’s results, and of those
given by Le Fort, has been called in question by Dr.
Duncan in his work already cited, partly on the authority of
certain results of home practice, quoted from Dr. M’Clintock,
who has collected the statistics of 16,774 deliveries
exclusively from home practice. There were among these
45 deaths from accidents of labour, 52 deaths from puerperal
diseases, and 34 deaths from non-puerperal diseases;
giving a total mortality of 131, or nearly 8 per 1,000. On
considering these figures, the first impression they convey
is not that either the Registrar-General or Le Fort is wrong.
But it is a very painful impression of another kind altogether.
One feels disposed to ask whether it can be true that, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>hands of educated accoucheurs, the inevitable fate of women
undergoing, not a diseased, but an entirely natural condition,
at home, is that one out of every 128 must die? If the facts
are correct, then one cannot help feeling that they present
a very strong <i>prima facie</i> case for enquiry, with the view
of devising a remedy for such a state of things. It
must be seen, however, that these statistics of home
practice are as open to the charge of want of accuracy as
those of the Registrar-General or Le Fort. The question
can only be settled by enquiry, and by more carefully kept
statistics of midwifery practice; but in the meantime here
are a few facts, kindly placed at my disposal by Mr. Rigden,
of Canterbury, which are by no means so hopeless as those
given by Dr. Duncan.</p>

<p class='c007'>‘An analysis of 4,132 consecutive cases in midwifery occurring
in private practice during a period of 30 years, particularly
in reference to mortality. Eight mothers died:
three from convulsions and coma; 4 from puerperal fever;
and one from heart disease, about an hour after a comparatively
easy labour.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The report states 8, but after it was supplied another
death took place, the day after delivery, making 9 in all.
The cause of death is not given.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Rigden explains that these figures relate only to the
first fortnight after delivery; but he states that if any other
deaths had taken place within the month, he must have
heard of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming the Deliveries at 4,133 and the Deaths at 9,
Mr. Rigden’s facts show a total mortality of 2·17 per 1,000,
of which less than 1 per 1,000 was due to puerperal fever.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 class='c001'><i>ESTIMATED APPROXIMATE HOME DEATH-RATE.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In estimating the probable accuracy of statistical data in
which there may be both excesses and deficiencies, sources
of error are diminished by largeness in the numbers employed
in striking averages. Bearing this in mind, and after
considering the objections brought against the accuracy of
the figures, there seems no reason for rejecting the Registrar-General’s
average total mortality among lying-in women in
England of 5·1 per 1,000, as affording a sufficiently close approximation
to the present real death-rate among lying-in
women delivered at home, for all practical purposes of comparison
with the death-rates in lying-in hospitals.</p>

institutions, they are small in comparison with those which
have ruled in many foreign hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Table X. contains an abstract from Dr. Le Fort’s work of
the statistics of 58 lying-in institutions in nearly every country
of Europe, and extending in many cases over a considerable
number of years. There is only one hospital (at Bourg) in
which there was no death in 4 years, out of 461 deliveries.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one hospital (at Troyes), with a death-rate of 4
per 1,000 on 460 deliveries in 4 years.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two instances of death-rates of 7 per 1,000.
There is one of 9, and there are two of 10 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In every other case the death-rates have exceeded these
amounts, rising higher and higher in different institutions,
until they culminate in a death-rate of no less than 140 per
1,000, at Strasburg, on a four years’ average among 556 deliveries.
Le Fort’s data show a striking variation in the
death-rates of the same hospitals in different years, as will
presently be seen to be the case in hospitals in this country.
There are instances in these foreign hospitals of the death-rates
varying from 4 to 7–fold in different groups of years
in the same hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Le Fort’s data show that in lying-in hospitals in various
countries and climates, scattered over nearly the whole of
Europe, out of 888,312 deliveries there were no fewer than
30,394 deaths, giving an average death-rate of 34 per 1,000,
a rate exceeding the high mortality which led to the discontinuance
of our school for training midwifery nurses in
King’s College Hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already seen, as a result of Dr. Le Fort’s tables,
that the mortality among women delivered at home, as deduced
by him, is 4·7 per 1,000; while in the hospital it is 34
per 1,000, or nearly 7½–fold. Making any reasonable allowance
for inaccuracy in the data, still we can hardly escape
from his conclusions any more than we can rid ourselves from
the consequences which follow from the data given above.
We must confront the question called up by the data taken
as a whole, viz., What can be the reason of this ascending
scale of fatality shown on Table VIII.? Why is it that
these death-rates from all causes in childbirth, beginning
at 5·1 per 1,000 for all England (town and country),
successively become, among the same people 9·, 10·9, 14·3,
25·3, 33·3; and if we cross the channel, why should they
mount up to 69, 70, and 95 per 1,000?</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, why should fevers and inflammations of the
puerperal class, which, as we have seen above, give a death-rate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>for all England of 1·61 per 1,000, mount up in English
hospitals to 3·4, 4·1, 14·3, and 29·4? There must be some
reason, besides the fact of childbirth, why diseases and
accidents of this condition should be 4 times more fatal in
a London lying-in hospital, and 15 times more fatal in
Parisian hospitals, than they are in towns of England. What,
then, are the immediate causes of these excessive death-rates?</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>CAUSES OF HIGH DEATH-RATES IN LYING-IN INSTITUTIONS.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>The determining causes of these death-rates need to be
discussed most cautiously;—our information concerning
them being so scanty.</p>

<p class='c007'>We know from Statistics that these Deaths occur, but
why they occur and why they vary are questions not yet to
be fully answered in our present stage of knowledge (or of
ignorance).</p>

<p class='c007'>At one time a sufficient cause seems to present itself; but
the very next outbreak of Puerperal disease may occur
under quite different conditions. For years an Institution
may escape excessive Mortality; and then it may suffer
severely under the same apparent circumstances. All that
we can do at present is to see whether there are removable
causes in cases where the Mortality is excessive, and to
remove them. Fully recognising how much we have need
of caution, this subject will be next considered generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and as far as possible in its practical bearings on the points
at issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some important remarks in Dr. Le Fort’s book,
bearing on this subject, which may find a place here.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Puerperal Fever.</i>—Dr. Le Fort states, as the result of his
enquiry, that the frequency of obstetrical operations modifies
the general mortality only in a slight degree; that the excessive
mortality in lying-in hospitals is much greater than
can be attributed to ordinary hospital influences; that it
depends neither on the social condition of the women, nor
on the moral conditions under which delivery may occur;
that it may be more or less influenced by the insalubrity of
particular hospitals, but that puerperal fever is the principal
cause of death after delivery; that this disease shows itself
in all hospitals, in all maternity institutions, in all climates,
in the south of France as it does at St. Petersburg, in
Dublin as in Vienna, in London as in Moscow. It exists in
America as in Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is less frequent and fatal during the summer months,
attributable in part at least to greater facilities of ventilation
following on higher temperature (in other words, to having
your windows open instead of shut).</p>

<p class='c007'>This disease develops itself spontaneously under certain
unknown circumstances. When it is about to become
epidemic, it is sometimes preceded by the prevalence of
erysipelas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Le Fort points out that what was considered a severe
epidemic in the British Lying-in Hospital, in the year 1770,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>is ‘unfortunately less than the <i>mean</i> mortality of the Maternité
at Paris.’</p>

<p class='c007'>While admitting that puerperal fever may originate <i>de
novo</i>, Dr. Le Fort dwells strongly on the communicability
of the disease as an efficient cause of its prevalence.</p>

<p class='c007'>He adduces opinions of the following physicians—Oppolzer,
Rokitansky, and Skoda, of Vienna; Virchow, of
Berlin; Lange, of Heidelberg; Schwarz, of Göttingen;
Löschner, of Prague; and Hecker, of Munich—on the nature
and origin of this fatal disease. Generally they testify to
the propagation of puerperal fever by contagion, but they
also state that it is a blood disease—a product of foul air,
putrid miasms, and predisposition to malignant inflammatory
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Le Fort also cites a number of interesting facts,
showing that the indiscriminate visiting by attendants of
lying-in women and patients suffering from disease, either
within or outside the same establishment, has been a means
of exciting puerperal fever action.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Admission of Students.</i>—It is one of the contingencies
necessarily due to connecting together the teaching of midwifery
to students, with other portions of clinical instruction,
that no precautions can prevent a student passing from a
bad surgical case, or from an anatomical theatre, to the
bedside of a lying-in woman, while sad experience has
proved that the most fatal results may ensue from this circumstance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course risks of this kind are greatly increased when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>there are lying-in wards in general hospitals—especially
if a medical school be attached to such a hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>This risk had not been overlooked in the arrangements
for the lying-in wards at King’s College Hospital, under
which, while intended solely for the training of midwifery
nurses, provision was made for a limited and regulated
attendance of students; but, when enquiries came to be
made into the probable cause of the high death-rates, it was
found that the restrictions laid down as to the admission of
students had been disregarded; also that there was a post-mortem
theatre almost under the ward windows.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Effect of Numbers.</i>—Dr. Le Fort has examined the influence
exercised by numbers—or, in other words, by the
size of hospitals—on the mortality after childbirth. His
general results may be briefly stated as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>In hospitals receiving annually more than 2,000 lying-in
cases, comprising the two Cliniques of Vienna, 1834–63; the
Maternités of Paris, 1849–59; of Prague, 1848–62; and
of Moscow, 1853–62; and the Lying-in Hospital of Dublin,
1847–54, the death-rate is 40·7 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In hospitals receiving between 1,000 and 2,000 cases a
year, including the Enfans Trouvés at Petersburg, 1845–59;
the Maternité at Munich, 1859–62, and other places, the
death-rate is 36 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In hospitals receiving from 500 to 1,000 cases a year,
including Pesth and the Maternité of Dresden, the death-rate
is nearly 27 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In hospitals where the number of deliveries is between
200 and 500 per annum, comprehending several places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>cited, among the rest Edinburgh and the London Lying-in
Hospital, 1833–60, the death-rate is 30½ per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In hospitals receiving between 100 and 200 cases, as
at Frankfort and Göttingen, the death-rate is 27·6 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in three small establishments receiving fewer than
100 a year, as at Lund, the death-rate is above 83½ per
1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these facts Dr. Le Fort concludes that the relative
mortality in small and large establishments is not favourable
to small hospitals, <i>per se</i>. The benefit of subdivision
may be neutralised by other circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must also protest against massing hospitals, alike only
in one circumstance, together for the sake of taking their
statistics <i>in bulk</i> in this way, except for the most general
purposes—which is indeed all Dr. Le Fort has in view here—especially
as our own lying-in institutions of these islands,
which come out best individually, appear here confounded
amongst the greatest sinners. But Dr. Le Fort’s general
conclusion, against the influence of size <i>per se</i>, is no doubt
correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general rule, statistics appear to show that the great
mortality of lying-in hospitals is of periodical occurrence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Puerperal women, as everyone knows, are the most
susceptible of all subjects to ‘blood-poisoning.’ The smallest
transference of putrescing miasm from a locality where
such miasm exists to the bedside of a lying-in patient is
most dangerous. Puerperal women are, moreover, exposed
to the risks of ‘blood-poisoning’ by the simple fact of being
brought together in lying-in wards, and especially by being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>retained a longer time than is absolutely necessary in lying-in
wards after being delivered, while to a great extent they
escape this entire class of risks by being attended at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are no doubt difficulties in assigning the exact
effect of every condition to which a lying-in woman may
be exposed in contributing to these death-rates, but there
are, nevertheless, a few great fundamental facts which arrest
attention in such an enquiry.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a fact, for instance, that however grand, or however
humble, a home may be in which the birth of a child takes
place, there is only one delivery in the home at one time.
Another fact is, that a second delivery will certainly not
take place in the same room, inhabited by the same couple,
for 10 months at least, and may not take place in the same
room for years. The Registrar-General has shown us that
under these conditions the death-rate among lying-in women
all over England, and from all registered causes, is about
5·1 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In many London workhouses the number of deliveries
yearly is so small that, so far as concerns annual deliveries,
they approach more closely to dwelling-houses divided
among a number of families than they do to lying-in
hospitals properly so called.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us now see what relation there is between the annual
deliveries and the death-rates in these workhouse wards.</p>

<p class='c007'>Assuming that the London workhouse lying-in wards
have certain conditions in common, we find that twenty-seven
infirmaries suffered from lying-in deaths in five years,
and that in thirteen there were no deaths in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>years. Now, in each of these twenty-seven hospitals
yielding deaths, the deliveries averaged 29 per annum,
while in the thirteen infirmaries without deaths the deliveries
averaged under 16 per annum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, in twenty-one infirmaries with deaths, the average
disposable space for each occupied lying-in bed was 2,246
cubic feet; while in nine infirmaries without deaths the
space per occupied bed averaged 3,149 cubic feet. These,
however, are only averages, and as such may be taken for
what they are worth. There were exceptions to these
rules in particular cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts regarding Waterford Lying-in Institution have
a very important bearing on this question of subdivision.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the years from 1838 to 1844 this hospital consisted of
two rooms in a small house. One room was a delivery
ward. The other held eight lying-in beds. The total
deliveries in this house amounted to 753, and there were
6 deaths = 8 per 1,000. Half this mortality was due to
puerperal fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October 1844 this hospital occupied another small
house, in which the eight lying-in beds were placed in two
rooms instead of one as formerly—four beds per room.
Up to October 1867 there had been 2,656 deliveries in this
house, and 9 deaths—a mortality of 3·4 per 1,000.
There were only two puerperal fever deaths in these 2,656
deliveries.</p>

<p class='c007'>These facts appear to show that subdivision among lying-in
cases has a certain influence in warding off mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, on the other hand, the death-rates among lying-in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>cases in particular hospitals are not always in the ratio of
the number of occupied beds. A few illustrations of this
will suffice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, in the year 1861, there were in the Rotunda
Hospital, Dublin, 1,135 deliveries, on which the death-rate
was 51·9 per 1,000. In 1828 the deliveries were 2,856,
and the death-rate 15 per 1,000. In the four years
1830 to 1833, the deliveries varied from 2,138 to 2,288, and
the death-rates were a little more than 5 per 1,000. In
Queen Charlotte’s Hospital the highest death-rate occurred
in 1849, during which year there were 161 deliveries.
The death-rate was 93·2 per 1,000, while in 1832, with
217 deliveries, the death-rate was just one tenth of this
amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Maison d’Accouchement at Paris, during the five
decennial periods between 1810 and 1859,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c009'><sup>[9]</sup></a> there were
141,476 deliveries, among which there occurred 6,288
deaths, giving a death-rate of 44·4 per 1,000. The lowest
death-rate in any of the decennial periods occurred
between 1840 and 1849, when it amounted to 41·9 per
1,000. The largest number of deliveries of any period in
the half century was during this ten years. They amounted
to 34,776; while, in the period from 1850 to 1859, the
deliveries were 24,944, and the death-rate 52 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dublin Rotunda approximates most to this Paris
Maternité in the large number of deliveries, vibrating
around 2,000 a year; while, in Queen Charlotte’s Hospital,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>where, even since its reconstruction, the mortality has been
in many years higher than in the Dublin Rotunda, the
number of annual deliveries has varied around 200.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Danger of Puerperal Epidemics.</i>—These facts have a
very important bearing on the whole question of lying-in
institutions, for they show that, with scarcely an exception,
while the lowest death-rate in any given year greatly
exceeds the average mortality among lying-in women
delivered at home, the inmates of these institutions are
exposed to the enormous additional risk of puerperal
epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Take, for instance, Queen Charlotte’s Hospital. There is
no reason to believe that less care and solicitude for the
welfare of its inmates is exercised than would be the case
if they were delivered at home. And yet we find that
year by year, from 1828 down to the present time, the
institution has only escaped deaths for four years. The
lowest death-rate it ever had was in 1835, when it
amounted to 4·6 per 1,000. In other years it has been
11, 15, 21, 30, 50, 70, 81, 86, and in one year it rose to
the immense death-rate of 93·2 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1849 there were, as above said, 161 deliveries out of
which fourteen women died from puerperal fever, being a
death-rate of 87 per 1,000 from this disease alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statistics of other lying-in institutions afford corresponding
data. It is a lamentable fact that the mortality
in lying-in wards from childbirth, which is <i>not</i> a disease,
approaches closely to the mortality from all diseases and
accidents together in general hospitals, and in many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>instances even greatly exceeds this mortality. It is the
more lamentable, because, as need scarcely be stated, the
causes of a higher mortality in infancy and old age cannot
exist at childbearing ages. Also, childbirth ought certainly
not to be a ‘miasmatic disease.’ Unless, then, it
can be clearly shown that these enormous death-rates can
be abated, or that they are altogether inevitable, does
not the whole of the evidence with regard to special
lying-in hospitals lead but to one conclusion, viz. that they
should be closed? Is there any conceivable amount of
privation which would warrant such a step as bringing
together a constant number of puerperal women into the
same room, in buildings constructed and managed on the
principles embodied in existing lying-in institutions?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Fatality of Lying-in Wards in General Hospitals.</i>—Besides
special lying-in hospitals, there are general hospitals
which receive lying-in cases. Fortunately, there are not
many such in England. But in Paris there are 11<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c009'><sup>[10]</sup></a> general
hospitals which receive midwifery cases. A reference to
Tables XI., XII., XIII., will show how great the risks are
to lying-in women under the same roof with medical and
surgical cases; a fact which may be further illustrated by a
reference to data for particular hospitals. For example, in
1861, 253 lying-in cases in La Charité gave a total death-rate
of 193·7 per 1,000, of which no less than 154·2 was
due to puerperal causes. These tables tell their own story,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>and they throw altogether into the shade the lamentable
losses at King’s College Hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only <i>amende</i> that could be made was to shut up the
ward; and having done this in the interest of womankind,
need it be said that the impression produced by these
statistics confirms the conclusion just stated in regard to
existing lying-in wards generally, and is that not a single
lying-in woman should ever pass within the doors of a
general hospital? Is not any risk which can be incurred
outside almost infinitely smaller? And as a general hospital
must always be a hospital, must not this verdict be an
absolute one, not one which can be altered or reversed?</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>INFLUENCE OF CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF LYING-IN WARDS ON THE DEATH-RATE.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>Before, however, surrendering entirely the principle of
special lying-in institutions, it is only fair to enquire whether
the construction, management, and arrangements of existing
hospitals of this class may possibly have had any influence
upon the mortality, apart from the mere fact of bringing
lying-in cases together under one roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>This question is the more important because we now know
that construction and arrangement of buildings exert a
notable effect on the death statistics of general hospitals.
It is at last universally admitted that airy open site, simplicity
of plan, subdivision of cases under a number of separate
pavilions, large cubic space, abundant fresh air, mainly from
windows on the opposite sides of the wards, drainage arrangements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>entirely outside the hospital, are essential conditions
to the safety of all general hospitals. But, as already stated,
it is likewise admitted that lying-in women are peculiarly
susceptible to ‘blood-poisoning.’</p>

<p class='c007'>This being the case, have we any reason to expect other
than a high death-rate if we collect lying-in women into
such wards, or rather rooms, as are found in many old hospitals?</p>

<p class='c007'>Nobody with ordinary knowledge of the subject, and
desirous simply of benefiting suffering people, would now
dream of appropriating buildings of this kind as hospitals
for sick. But it is to be feared that the same scruple
has not always existed with regard to lying-in women.
And as we now know that such buildings give high death-rates
among sick and wounded people, there is every reason
to fear that they have had their share in raising the death-rate
among lying-in women to a greater extent than that
due merely to the fact of agglomeration. As instances of
the existence of danger from such causes, and also from
grave errors in administration, two or three illustrations
are here introduced from existing lying-in establishments.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Maternité, Paris.</i>—We have seen from the statistics that
the chief of chief offenders in times past has been the
Maternité at Paris. This establishment was in former
times the monastery of ‘Port Royal de Paris.’ It is situated
in one of the most healthy open spots on the outskirts
of the French capital, and, as far as situation is concerned,
ought to be healthy. The building was devoted to its
present destination in 1795, and has undergone many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>changes since that date. It contains 228 beds for lying-in
women, and, besides, accommodation for 94 pupil midwives.
From 1,000 to 2,200 deliveries and upwards take place
here annually: from 1840 to 1849 there were as many as
3,400 annually. Until recently it consisted properly of three
divisions, delivery wards, cells for delivered women in the
process of recovery, and an infirmary.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delivery ward is well-lighted on two sides, and communicates
with an operation theatre, where lectures are also
given.</p>

<p class='c007'>The woman, if progressing favourably after delivery,
was removed to one of the cells in what may be called the
recovery ward. The construction of these cells was as
follows:—a long corridor, with windows on opposite sides,
was divided into separate cells, each cell having its own
window, by partitions stretching one third across the
corridor, but not cut off on the end towards the middle of
the corridor. Each cell was provided with a bed and a
cradle, so that in walking up the centre of the corridor the
divisions, or rather the cells, opened right and left from the
passage, like the stalls of a stable. This construction
rendered it almost impossible to open the windows. The
infirmary consisted of small wards of three or four beds
each, into which were moved indiscriminately patients
suffering with all classes of disease. And it appears, from
Dr. Le Fort’s account, that pupil midwives had at the same
time patients in the infirmary, and healthy women, both
delivered and not delivered, under their care. Pregnant
women are often admitted weeks, and even months before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>delivery, at the Maternité. [So also at the Midwives’
Clinique at Vienna.]</p>

<p class='c007'>Recently the cells have been removed from the corridor,
and glass partitions have been thrown across from back to
front, each division containing six beds, but communicating
with the adjoining divisions by means of doors intended to
be used only when the service requires it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infirmary has been completely separated from this
portion of the establishment, but all classes of cases are
still transferred into the infirmary as before.</p>

<p class='c007'>As consequences of these arrangements, we have in the
Maternité the following conditions:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The agglomeration of a number of lying-in women
under the same roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. An internal construction of the building not suited to
give fresh air, to say the least of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The infirmary until recently connected with the other
portions of the building, and even now receiving all classes
of cases among lying-in women, whether febrile or not, for
treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. One class of attendants devoted indiscriminately to all
classes of inmates.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. As already mentioned, women admitted and retained
within the walls of the establishment before and after the
time simply required for delivery and convalescence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly, an enormous death-rate mainly from puerperal
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Hôpital de la Clinique, Paris.</i>—This establishment is part
of the hospital for clinical instruction, close to the buildings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>of the École de Médecine. The hospital consists of a parallelogram
with a central court, containing not only the
clinical surgery wards, but also an amphitheatre devoted to
anatomical studies, with a mean number of fifty corpses in
the course of dissection.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are six wards devoted to the midwifery department,
arranged in a complicated manner, partly across
the corridor, and partly on each side of the corridor, all
of them entered from a central passage lighted by the
open doors of the wards along the sides. They contained
54 lying-in beds. From 800 to 900 deliveries took place
here annually. 18 to 20 days appear to be the average
stay. The beds must, therefore, have been pretty constantly
full.</p>

<p class='c007'>The wards devoted to women who have been delivered
communicate freely with one another by open doors. The
beds are curtained, and the curtains are washed only once
in six months, even though the occupants of the bed may
have died of puerperal fever. The beds are of iron, and are
provided with a spring mattress, over which is a wool
mattress. The latter is removed after each delivery,
cleansed, and renewed. There is no infirmary for diseases;
whether cases of puerperal fever or others, all are treated
in the beds in which they are placed after delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The female staff performs its duty to all classes of cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Students entered upon the roll for midwifery practice
are called into the wards from other parts of the establishment
by signals placed in a window.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is quite unnecessary to search for any more recondite

<p>HÔPITAL DE LA CLINIQUE, PARIS.<br>  <br>  (<i>Former arrangement of Lying-in Wards.</i>)</p>

<p class='c007'>The above plan, taken from M. Husson’s ‘Étude sur
les Hôpitaux,’ will show the arrangement of wards and beds
in this place. [Dr. Le Fort says that the number of beds
in each ward has since been reduced by a third.]</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Queen Charlotte’s Lying-in Hospital, London.</i>—Plate I.
shows a plan and section of Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, as
rebuilt in 1856.</p>

<p class='c007'>On each floor are 6 wards, containing 3 beds each, in
which the patients are delivered, with an average of 1,000
cubic feet to each patient. On each floor, also, is one convalescent
ward, containing 6 beds. Two floors are devoted
to patients: one for married, and one for single women.
As soon as 3 patients have been delivered in a ward, it
remains vacant for 8 or 10 days, and is cleansed. Patients
are removed as soon as possible to the convalescent ward.
When a case of fever occurs, the ward is freshly whitewashed,
and not occupied again for at least a month.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>In this building we have three floors and a basement.
A drain runs from back to front of the building, right across
the basement—a most unsafe course for a drain in any inhabited
building.<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c009'><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen that the rooms are placed on opposite
sides of a main corridor running the lengthway of the
building on each floor; that the corridors of the different
floors communicate by the stairs; that the ventilation of
each room communicates with the ventilation of every other
room through the corridors; that none of the rooms have
windows on opposite sides, and that there are water-closets
having a ventilation common to that of the building. Now
every one of these structural arrangements is objectionable,
and would be considered so in any good hospital, and
nobody now-a-days would venture to include all of them in
a general hospital plan. They are hence <i>à fortiori</i> altogether
inadmissible in a building for the reception of lying-in
women.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have thus, in Queen Charlotte’s Hospital, the following
defects:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Agglomeration of a number of cases under the same
roof.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. A form of construction unsuited for hospital purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. No means of removing outside the building febrile
or other cases of puerperal diseases from the vicinity of
patients recovering after delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Since 1856, notwithstanding the great improvements, the
death-rates per 1,000 have been 12·2, 8·8, 81·2, 70·3, 54·2,
39·2, 15·5, and so on: in several years very considerably
larger than the mortality which led to the closing of the
lying-in wards in King’s College Hospital. These varying
deaths lead to the exercise of much caution in drawing conclusions
as to their causes; but the main fact remains, namely,
there are the death-rates, and they are many times greater
than occur among London poor women delivered at home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>The plan shows the relation of the delivery wards to the
recovery ward, and to the other parts of the hospital; to
the lecture room, post mortem theatre, &#38;c. The main defects
in the construction are: the back to back wards; proximity
of these wards to the general wards of the hospital; the large
staircase, common to both sets of wards, although its size
and openness, and the windows opposite each other and on
each floor, ensured ventilation, and separated the respective
blocks; the position of the post-mortem theatre, the smell
from which, as stated on the best authority, could be distinctly
detected in the wards. As already stated, students
were admitted from other parts of the hospital to the midwifery
wards.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>RESULTS OF IMPROVED LYING-IN WARD CONSTRUCTION.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>A few instances of improved lying-in ward construction,
together with the death-rates in these establishments, will
next be given.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Military Female Hospitals.</i>—These buildings vary in constructive
arrangements. Some are much better than others,
and during recent years lying-in wards of improved construction
have been provided in connection with several
newly erected military female hospitals. The earlier plans
of the new female hospitals consist of a block formed of two
pavilions joined end to end, with a passage across the block
to separate the pavilions from each other. Each pavilion
contains a single ward, with its own separate offices and
nurses’ rooms. It has windows on opposite sides, with one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>large end window, and abundant means of warming and
ventilation. One pavilion is devoted to general cases, the
other to lying-in cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The midwifery ward has space for twelve beds. Each
bed has a superficial area of ninety square feet, and a cubic
space of 1,350 feet. The wards are fifteen feet high.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two hospitals on this plan have been in use at Woolwich
and Chatham for upwards of six years. During this period
there have been at the two 1,093 deliveries, and 11 deaths.
At Chatham there was one accidental death from removal
of the patient to hospital, and out of 342 deliveries there
have been no deaths from puerperal diseases. There were,
however, two deaths from scarlet fever, occurring while
this disease was prevalent in soldiers’ families in the garrison.
At Woolwich, among 751 deliveries, there have been 8
deaths, of which five were from puerperal diseases, but of
these five deaths one took place in a woman who had
gastric fever at the time of admission, and in other two
women puerperal peritonitis came on after instrumental
delivery. There was one death from embolism, one from
exhaustion, and one from dropsy. The total death-rate in
these two hospitals has been under 10 per 1,000. The
deaths due to diseases and accidents of childbirth have been
6, or at the rate of 5½ per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the other military hospitals, the statistics of which are
given in Table IV., Devonport and Portsmouth are unsuitable
adapted buildings. Aldershot Hospital consists of
a number of huts joined together as a general female hospital,
with accommodation for all kinds of cases, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>lying-in cases. This arrangement is a very undesirable one,
and the results have been unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Table XIV. shows that the total mortality in this hospital
has been 10·1 per 1,000. Of the total deaths 27 are
attributed to diseases and accidents of childbirth, affording
a mortality of 8·8 per 1,000, or double that of the
healthy districts of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we exclude Aldershot as being unfit for childbirth cases,
we find that in the other seven hospitals the total mortality,
as shown in Table XIV., has been 7·4 per 1,000. The mortality
from puerperal diseases in these hospitals has been
2·7 per 1,000, and from diseases and accidents of childbirth
5·4 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two camp hospitals for lying-in cases, consisting
only of wooden huts, appropriated for the purpose, which
have yielded very important experience. One of these is at
Colchester, the other at Shorncliffe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Shorncliffe Hospital is an old wooden hut of the
simplest construction, with thorough ventilation. It is
situated on a rising ground close to the sea, and facing it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>so that the sea breeze sweeps right through it. It is scarcely
more than a makeshift. And here are the results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Table IV. shows that up to December 1869, there had
been 702 deliveries in the hut, among which there was one
death from scarlet fever, and one from hæmorrhage, besides
two deaths following on craniotomy. There was not a
single death from any puerperal disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Colchester Lying-in Hospital, of which a plan and section
are given on Plate II., is nothing more than an ordinary
officer’s wooden hut, divided by partitions into four compartments,
with a transverse passage cutting them off from
each other. This hut has been in use for a considerable
number of years as a place of lying-in for soldiers’ wives
living in the camp, and there have been altogether between
500 and 600 deliveries in it. The matron states that
during the whole time the hut has been in use for its present
purpose, no death has taken place in it. But as statistics
have only been kept since 1865, we shall limit our attention
to them. They show that, up to the end of October 1870,
there had been 252 registered deliveries, and no deaths.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>The results of these two makeshift hospitals, when compared
with the figures already given for lying-in establishments
generally, are certainly remarkable. They are both
detached buildings, having no connection with any general
hospital. Their construction ensures a plentiful supply of
fresh air at all times. They contain very few beds, and
these beds are occupied, seldom or never, all at one time.
Indeed, it is stated that in the Colchester hut there is
scarcely more than one, or at most two beds, constantly
occupied throughout the year. Also, soldiers’ wives lying-in
rarely remain more than ten days, though sometimes
twelve in hospital. There is, therefore, no crowding;
scrupulous cleanliness is observed; there are no sources
of putrid miasm in or near the lying-in huts; and they
have their own attendants. The data in Table IV. show
that there have been 954 registered deliveries in the two
huts, and four deaths, of which three were due to puerperal
accidents, and none to puerperal diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Proposed new Female Hospital at Portsmouth.</i>—When
military female hospitals were first designed, it was intended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>that they should receive only lying-in and general cases
from married soldiers’ families in separate pavilions. But
at a subsequent date zymotic cases were admitted into the
same pavilion with general cases. Very decided objections
were, however, urged against this step by medical officers,
and the next hospital planned was divided into three distinct
pavilions. It was intended for Portsmouth garrison, and is
shown in the annexed figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>A female hospital on this plan has been erected at Dublin,
with the two end wards built in the line of the corridor
beyond the ends of it, in place of at right angles to the corridor,
as shown in the proposed Portsmouth plan. By this
form of construction the cases received from soldiers’ families
can be divided into three classes: general, infectious,
and midwifery—each class in its own separate building.
Such, however, has been the feeling of medical officers as to
the undesirableness of trusting even to this amount of separation,
that at Dublin the ‘infectious’ cases have been removed
to another locality altogether. The same separation
had been already effected at Chatham and Woolwich.</p>

<p class='c007'>Close observation of lying-in cases has led to further
change in the construction, and it is now proposed to adopt
for lying-in wards in female hospitals a different form of
arrangement altogether: namely, to divide the lying-in
pavilion into separate one-bed rooms, as shown on Plan IV.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experience of these small military female lying-in
hospitals has shown the favourable effect of simplicity of
construction, plenty of space, light, and fresh air, perfect
cleanliness, a small number of lying-in beds, not by any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>means constantly occupied, administration separate from
that of general hospitals, and allowing the lying-in women
to return to quarters in as few days after delivery as their
recovery admits.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there is one remarkable instance in which a plan of
construction, on the principle of the earlier British military
female hospitals described above, has been adopted without
having led to equally satisfactory results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new ‘Maternité’ belonging to the Hôpital Cochin at
Paris has been constructed on a ground-plan similar to that
at Woolwich, viz., with two pavilions projecting in line
from a centre, and containing two ten-bed wards. It is in
two floors, with small wards on the upper floor. Part of its
sanitary arrangements are certainly not what we should
adopt in this country, but there are many hospitals in
which there are worse defects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Puerperal fever appeared in this hospital within a month
of its being opened.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where so much attention had been paid to construction,
the causes of the fever must be looked for somewhere else
than in the ward plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Le Fort has stated that puerperal fever cases had been
retained temporarily in the wards after the development
of the disease; that the same nurses took charge, not only
of cases of disease in the isolated wards, but also of women
making healthy recoveries; and that there is nothing to prevent
the medical attendant passing almost directly from the
autopsy of a puerperal fever case to render assistance to a
healthy woman.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>This experience is very important. It shows how much
the safety of lying-in hospitals depends on common-sense
management, and that it would be disastrous to trust to
improved construction alone, while everything else is left to
take its own course.</p>

<p class='c007'>We now arrive at the consideration of an elementary
point:—</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>SHOULD MEDICAL STUDENTS BE ADMITTED TO LYING-IN HOSPITAL PRACTICE?</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>This is a very grave question. Medical students were admitted
to the lying-in wards at King’s College Hospital. Was
this one cause of the occurrence of puerperal diseases there?</p>

<p class='c007'>There are facts, it is true, such as those supplied by the
Maternité and Clinique at Paris (the latter only admitting
medical students), in both of which establishments the mortality
is excessive, which on first sight appear to show that
the presence of medical students in a lying-in hospital is
not necessarily a cause of adding to a mortality already
excessive. But on the other hand there are facts, such as
those given by Dr. Le Fort, admitting of a comparison being
made between the mortality in lying-in wards to which
medical students are admitted with the mortality in other
wards of the same establishment not admitting students,
which appear to establish the point conclusively. The
special case he cites is the following:—</p>

<p class='c007'>At Vienna there are two lying-in cliniques, one for
students and one for midwives. They are both situated in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the same hospital, and their external conditions are insufficient
in themselves to explain the facts now to be noted.
Puerperal fever prevailed in the hospital during the same
months in ten separate years, from 1838 to 1862, and the
following table gives the mortality per 1,000 in each set of
clinical wards:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it not quite clear that some bad influence was at work
in this case on the students’ side, which was not in force on
the pupil midwives’ side? That there was something else in
operation besides epidemic influence is shown by the much
greater frequency and severity of puerperal diseases in the
one clinique than in the other. We may assume the fact
without attempting to explain it, as a proof of the necessity
of separating midwifery instruction altogether from ordinary
hospital clinical instruction; and does not this Vienna history
throw fresh light on the experience already alluded to
of our midwives’ school in King’s College Hospital?</p>

  <h3 class='c026'><i>INFLUENCE OF TIME SPENT IN A LYING-IN WARD ON THE DEATH-RATE.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c027'>This very important element in the question of mortality
has been already referred to. There appear to be no
extant statistics to show the relation of the death-rate to the
period of residence. This much, however, is known—that in
the establishments where the death-rate is highest the probable
effect of length of residence appears not to be considered,
while in the cases cited where the death-rates are
lowest the women leave the hospital as soon as they are able
to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Le Fort, however, quotes Tarnier and Lasserre of
Paris, and Späth of Vienna, as holding that the death-rate is
lower among women admitted some time before labour.
‘They become acclimatised’ (an odd expression, when
applied to the foul air of an establishment where there
should be no foul air). He also says that puerperal fever is
very rare among women brought into hospital <i>after</i> delivery,
and he asks whether ‘contamination does not take place
principally and almost solely at the moment of accouchement.’</p>

<p class='c007'>One can only repeat, what indeed Le Fort states, that in
these most important points of enquiry, the very elements
are yet wanting to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some hospitals have rather plumed themselves on their
humanity in giving shelter to poor lying-in women as long
as possible, while in military lying-in hospitals soldiers’
wives are obliged to go home as soon as they can, to help
the domestic earnings. In the first class the death-rate is
high, in the last it is low.</p>

<p class='c007'>The low death-rates in workhouse lying-in wards appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>to support this conclusion also. These do not retain together
women not yet in labour, women in labour, women
delivered, and convalescent women. Their principle, on the
contrary, is to receive women when labour is imminent, and
to send them out of the ward as speedily as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>A moment’s consideration will be sufficient to show how
important a point in management this is. If there is any
danger at all to puerperal women in a lying-in institution (a
fact which has been proved), is it not clear that the danger
must become cumulative? It will increase in a certain
ratio as the length of residence increases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blood-poisoning, if once begun, will not stop of itself
unless the subject of it be removed from the cause, or the
cause from the subject, if it stop even then. To retain both
subject and cause together is simply to render certain that
which under better management might have been evanescent.
The more this question is considered the more important
does it appear, as involving an element exercising a
very considerable influence on the ultimate fate of inmates
of lying-in institutions. The institution, by retaining its
inmates, becomes a hospital; and, as such, subjects its
inmates to hospital influences while in the most susceptible
of all conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absence of information in almost all published statistics
on the point would be grotesque, if it were not alarming from
the carelessness it shows. With some difficulty the following
few meagre data have been scraped together as to the
average number of days lying-in women spend in the undermentioned
institutions:—</p>

<p class='c025'>This involves the question of management, which is next to
be considered.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>EFFECT OF GOOD MANAGEMENT ON THE SUCCESS OF LYING-IN ESTABLISHMENTS.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>The most important experience which can be had as to
the effect of good management in preventing the development
of puerperal diseases is afforded by the results of midwifery
cases in workhouse infirmaries. In none of these
institutions is there any great refinement of construction or
of sanitary appliances, and nevertheless their death-rates
have been much lower than those of maternity institutions
generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Table V. are given the statistics of the lying-in wards
of Liverpool workhouse for thirteen years. During this
period there were an approximate number of 6,396 deliveries
and 58 deaths, giving a total death-rate of 9·06 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of these deaths 22 were from puerperal diseases—equal
to a death-rate of 3·4 per 1,000. There were
14 deaths from accidents of childbirth—equal to a death-rate
of 2·2 per 1,000. The aggregate death-rate from
puerperal diseases and accidents of childbirth was 5·6 per
1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>These deaths are said to include all among puerperal
women delivered in these lying-in wards, whether occurring
within or without the maternity division. Mr. Barnes, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>medical officer of the establishment, states that he can
‘answer for this with certainty’ during the last 5 years.
Also, that no lying-in woman is discharged out of the workhouse
unless in perfect health, so that no puerperal death can
have happened after discharge. Mr. Barnes has farther
been kind enough to supply data for the following 3 years’
statistics, to show the general character of the cases which
have furnished these low death-rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us now see what the arrangements are for this class
of cases. The lying-in department of Liverpool workhouse
is situated in a wing of the female general hospital, contiguous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to the surgical wards. The wing has windows along the
two opposite sides and at one end; but the space is so
divided off by partitions as to form five wards, each of which
has windows along one side only. The wards are allotted
in the following manner:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Two of them, opening into each other, and facing the same
way, contain each twelve double beds, affording accommodation
for 24 inmates per ward, 48 in all, at 345 cubic feet
per inmate. These two wards are devoted to the reception
of pregnant women before delivery. The opposite half of
the wing is divided into two wards, corresponding to the
two pregnant wards; one of these is the delivery ward, and
contains seven beds, at nearly 1,200 cubic feet per bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Entering from this delivery ward is the lying-in ward,
lighted by windows at the end. This ward contains 14
beds, at 900 cubic feet per bed. The other ward, entering
from the delivery ward in the same line, is for convalescents,
and contains eleven beds, at 762 cubic feet per bed. The
W. C.’s, &#38;c., are between the wards in the wing, in a very
objectionable position.</p>

<p class='c007'>For these and the following details I am indebted to the
kindness of Mr. Barnes, who also supplied me with the
statistics abstracted on Table V.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following is the routine management of this establishment:—</p>

<p class='c007'>All the wards are lime-washed three or four times a year.
They are shut up and fumigated after the occurrence of any
serious case of illness. The floors are washed daily.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beds in the pregnant, lying-in, and convalescent wards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>are generally all or most of them occupied; but the number of
occupied beds in the delivery ward rarely exceeds four or
five.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bed clothes are changed after each delivery, and the
beds, which are of straw, after every third delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The patients consist for the most part of unmarried women.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c009'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
They are admitted into the pregnant wards, where they
remain for a varying interval of from days to months, from
whence they are removed to the delivery ward; about a fifth
part of the women are admitted directly from the town to
the delivery ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>They remain on an average eight hours in the delivery
room, whence they are removed to the lying-in ward, where
they remain five or six days. They are then admitted to the
convalescent ward, and are finally discharged fourteen days
after labour, one half to the town, the other half into other
parts of the workhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important part of the management is that the inmates
of the pregnant wards only inhabit those wards at night,
being engaged during the day in various occupations within
the workhouse, but not about the lying-in women, as in the
Paris Maternité.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases are not taken into the lying-in division unless labour
has begun, or is supposed to be imminent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any case of illness occurring in the lying-in department is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>at once removed to the ‘class sick nursery,’ to the lock or
other division.</p>

<p class='c007'>The nurses engaged in the lying-in division attend also
cases in the ‘class sick nursery,’ and are periodically changed.
Any case which they cannot manage is referred to the resident
medical officer on duty.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are three of these officers, who relieve each other
every eight hours day and night. The officer on duty is liable
to be called on to visit any part of the workhouse or hospital
during his turn of duty, so that it might happen occasionally
that the medical officer might be called from the hospital to
the lying-in division.</p>

<p class='c007'>If feverish symptoms show themselves in any patient in
the lying-in division, the practice is to isolate the case or
to transfer it to some other division of the workhouse. The
ward is then closed, fumigated, cleansed, and lime-washed,
before being again used.</p>

<p class='c007'>This proceeding has only been necessary twice within the
last four years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until recently, the whole of the deliveries, which amounted
to an average of about 500 a year, were under the charge of
one paid officer and a pauper who, without any payment
or extra diet, delivered nearly every case and worked both
night and day.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several points in this procedure which are of
great importance, as bearing on the general question of successful
management of lying-in establishments:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The building, although situated in a large commercial
town, is on a high, isolated, and freely ventilated locality.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>2. It is not connected with a general hospital or medical
school, or with any of their risks.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. There is a constant change of wards:—pregnant ward,
delivery ward, lying-in ward, recovery ward, body of the
house. There is, in short, as little risk as possible of the
cumulative blood-poisoning process already referred to.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Frequent cleansing and lime-washing.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Passing women who have been delivered as speedily
as possible out of the division altogether, either into the
house or outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. The deliveries being conducted by a woman specially
attached to the delivery ward, and no part of whose duty it
is to attend sick.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. The immediate isolation or removal of all cases exhibiting
feverish symptoms and their treatment out of the
division.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. The reduction of intercommunication between the
lying-in and hospital divisions to the smallest possible
degree on the part of medical officers and nurses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The practical result of this system of management has
been, as we have seen, that the lying-in division of this workhouse,
although working under many singular disadvantages,
has escaped the usual fatality of special lying-in hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the thirteen years included in the tables there has
been no epidemic, and the deaths have almost always been
single and disconnected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experience of lying-in wards in London workhouses
somewhat resembles the experience of Liverpool workhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the report of the committee appointed to consider the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>cubic space of metropolitan workhouses, 1867, is given a
table, No. 11, shewing the number of deliveries and deaths
after delivery during five years in forty metropolitan
workhouses.</p>

<p class='c007'>The leading facts are abstracted in Table VI. Workhouses
in which deaths after delivery took place, during the
five years, are separated in the abstract from workhouses
in which no deaths took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were during these five years in all the workhouses
11,870 deliveries and 93 deaths, giving a death-rate of
7·8 per 1,000. The deaths from puerperal diseases
amounted to 39, giving a death-rate of 3·3 per 1,000.
There were 20 deaths from accidents of childbirth; being a
death-rate of 1·7 per 1,000. The total death-rate due to
both classes was 5 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest number of deliveries took place in Marylebone
and in St. Pancras. In the former, on an average of
243 deliveries per annum, the death-rate was 8·2 per 1,000.
One half of this, however, was due to consumption. Of
the remaining deaths 3 were due to puerperal diseases
(2·4 per 1,000) and 2 to accidents. The death-rate due
to puerperal diseases and accidents of childbirth was thus
4·1 per 1,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>In St. Pancras workhouse, on an average of 200 deliveries
per annum, the death-rate was 11 per 1,000, of which
9 per 1,000 were due to puerperal diseases. Recent
disclosures with regard to St. Pancras workhouse may to
some extent account for this high death-rate. The number
of deliveries in these two workhouses bring them almost
within the category of lying-in hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>There are four other workhouses in which the annual
deliveries are respectively 171, 120, and two of them 111,
while in all the others the numbers fall much below 100.</p>

<p class='c007'>In one such instance (Holborn), where the deliveries have
averaged fifty a year, the death-rate was exceptionally
high, 24 per 1,000, one half of which was due to
puerperal disease. In another instance, St. Mary’s, Islington,
with seventy-five deliveries per annum, the death-rate
averaged 29 per 1,000. But the causes are not stated,
and cannot now be ascertained. In Whitechapel, where
there were 111 deliveries per annum, the death-rate was
10·8 per 1,000, one half being due to puerperal
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is possible that local enquiry might elucidate the
causes of this mortality. The cases are, however, exceptional
to the experience of London workhouses, viz. that the
death-rates from puerperal diseases and accidents of childbirth
are scarcely higher than they are in all England, town
and country. Let us try to ascertain how far the management
adopted may have led to these comparatively favourable
results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conditions for recovery in a great majority of the
London workhouse lying-in wards are at least as favourable as
they are in the Liverpool workhouse; in most cases undoubtedly
more so, as will immediately be seen when we
consider that the average annual number of deliveries in
Liverpool workhouse is more than twice that of the two
largest London workhouses, and from five to ten times
most of the others; that in the London workhouses the rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>is to have many unoccupied beds, while this is the exception
in the Liverpool workhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cardinal principle in the management of these
London workhouse lying-in wards appears to be this: their
occupants are a fluctuating number; often the wards have
but one woman at a time, and the cubic space for each of
these women is ‘in fact the cubic space of the whole ward.’<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c009'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
Sometimes, but only for brief periods, all the lying-in beds
may be occupied. For much longer intervals the occupants
are very few in number, so that each has a large
proportion of cubic space, and sometimes the wards in some of
the workhouses are empty. There are no medical schools
attached to the institutions, and no medical students who
may have passed from a case of erysipelas or from the post-mortem
theatre to the lying-in bedside; there is the
possibility of removing immediately any case of febrile or
other disease which may occur in the lying-in ward into
the general sick wards of the workhouse; there is discharge
of convalescent cases at the earliest possible period, either to
their own homes or to other parts of the establishment;
these conditions, together with the paucity of numbers
and the occasional vacating and rest of the wards, appear
to constitute the main difference between a workhouse
lying-in ward and a lying-in hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both classes of establishments the same attention is
doubtless bestowed on ventilation, cleanliness, and frequent
change of bedding.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h3 class='c026'><i>MANAGEMENT OF MILITARY LYING-IN WARDS.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c027'>The lying-in arrangements provided for soldiers’ wives
are as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The rule is that women shall be delivered in quarters,
provided there be decent accommodation. At a number of
the larger stations, where suitable married quarters have not
yet been fully provided, there are female hospitals, attached
to which, as we have already seen, is a delivery and lying-in
ward, with the usual offices. In the specially constructed
hospitals the wards are of a good size, well-lighted, warmed
and ventilated. If all the beds were occupied, the space
would be 1,300 cubic feet per patient. But this is an event
which rarely or never happens, so that there is always
plenty of room and good ventilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>If<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c009'><sup>[19]</sup></a> a woman requires admission, her husband applies to
the medical authorities for a ticket. No woman with a
disease considered to be infectious is admitted. The
women usually follow their ordinary avocations until obliged
to proceed to hospital by imminent labour. They are
taken there in cabs, all the necessary arrangements for the
lying-in having been made, if possible, by previous intimation.
The woman is delivered in the delivery ward, and
is thence transferred to the lying-in ward. As a rule, the
lying-in pavilion in these female hospitals is distinct in
all its arrangements for nursing from the pavilion for
general cases. Infectious cases are not received into the
same hospital, except at Aldershot.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>In these hospitals for soldiers’ wives the time which
elapses from the admission to the discharge of the women is
usually ten, and in some cases twelve days.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Aldershot four ‘Sisters’ are now at work in the
soldiers’ wives’ hospital. One was trained as midwife, and
took charge of the midwifery cases early in 1867. The
Sister midwife has sole charge of the lying-in women for
five or six days. They are then passed into a third ward,
and are nursed by the Sisters who attend the ordinary cases
(which are, however, of course in a separate ward).</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sisters do not help the midwife, as a rule. Only the
Superior, on an emergency, and one for scrubbing floors
periodically, enter the midwifery wards (i.e. the delivery
and lying-in wards).</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1869 Aldershot had no fatal case among the lying-in
women.</p>

<p class='c007'>[The ‘infection wards’ are nursed by ordinary nurses,
and in cases of children by the parents.]</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be seen, therefore, that at Aldershot the midwife
has nothing to do with the general cases, and the matron
is not now the midwife. Both there and at Woolwich the
lying-in nursing is quite separate from the general nursing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The medical officer remarks, as to the two deaths in
1869 at Woolwich: ‘Two cases of puerperal peritonitis
after bad labours, requiring instrumental and other assistance,
died, but the disease did not extend. My opinion is that
the coldness of the wards, though objectionable, has a great
deal to do with the comparative immunity hitherto enjoyed
as regards the germination and extension of contagious
diseases.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>It need scarcely be said that these new hospitals are
models of cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Colchester Hut the patient is received into a separate
compartment, of which there are four, where she is
delivered and remains until discharged to quarters.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very rarely indeed, if ever, that all the four compartments
are occupied simultaneously. The average stay is ten
days; the average number of deliveries a year under 50.</p>

<p class='c007'>This hut does not form part of a hospital. It is a separate
establishment, solely for lying-in women, as such accommodation
should always be.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Note.</i>—There is another reason, though it may be termed a
fanciful one, for altogether disconnecting lying-in institutions
with general hospitals, and even with the name and idea of
hospital. It is this: there must be a certain death-rate
in a general hospital, receiving as it does fatal diseases and
fatal accidents, as long as men and women have fatal diseases
and fatal accidents.</p>

<p class='c007'>But lying-in is not a fatal disease, nor a disease at all. It
is not a fatal accident, nor an accident at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unless from causes unconnected with the puerperal state,
no woman ought to die in her lying-in; and there ought, in a
lying-in institution, to be no death-rate at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is dangerously deadening our senses to this fact—viz.,
that there ought to be <i>no</i> deaths in a lying-in institution—if
we connect it in the least degree with the name of hospital,
so long as a hospital means a place for the reception of
diseases and accidents.</p>

<p class='c007'>In French statistics, this confusion of ideas, were it not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ghastly, would be ludicrous. ‘Admissions,’ under the head
‘Malades,’ include not only the lying-in women, but the
new-born infants, which appear to be ‘admitted’ to life and
to hospital together, as if life were synonymous with disease,
so that, e.g. 4,000 ‘Admissions,’ in such a year, to the
Paris Maternité would mean 2,000 deliveries, 2,000 births—[and—how
many deaths?]</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>RECAPITULATION.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>In summing up the evidence regarding excessive mortality
in lying-in institutions and its causes, it appears:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That, making every allowance for unavoidable inaccuracies
in statistics of midwifery practice, there is sufficient
evidence to show that in lying-in wards there reigns a
death-rate many times the amount of that which takes place
in home deliveries.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That a great cause of mortality in these establishments
is ‘blood-poisoning,’ and that this arises from the greater
susceptibility of lying-in women to diseases connected with
this cause. From whence it follows that in many lying-in
wards, as at present arranged and managed, there must be
conditions and circumstances apart from those belonging to
the inmates personally, which aid in the development of this
morbid state.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That the risks to which lying-in women are exposed
from puerperal diseases are increased by crowding cases in
all stages into the same room or under the same roof; by
retaining them for too long a period in the same room;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>by using the same room for too long a period without
cleansing, evacuation, rest, and thorough airing: but that
the death-rate is not always in proportion to the number of
lying-in cases which have passed through the hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from this that, other things being equal, a high
death-rate may take place in a small hospital constantly used
up to its capacity as well as in a large hospital constantly
used up to its capacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That there are superadded causes in some establishments
which add greatly to their dangers. Among these
may be reckoned the following:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_3'>
    <dt>(<i>a</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Prevalence of puerperal fever as an epidemic outside the hospital.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>b</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Including midwifery wards within general hospitals, thereby incurring the risk of 
    contaminating the air in midwifery wards with hospital emanations.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>c</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Proximity to midwifery wards of post-mortem theatres or other external sources of 
    putrescence.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>d</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Admitting medical students from general hospitals or from anatomical schools to practice 
    or even to visit in midwifery wards without special precautions for avoiding injury.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>e</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Treating cases of puerperal disease in the same ward, or under the same roof, with 
    midwifery cases.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>f</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Permitting the same attendants to act in infirmary wards and in lying-in wards, and using 
    the same bedding, clothing, utensils, &#38;c., in both.
    </dd>
    <dt>(<i>g</i>)</dt>
    <dd>Most probably also—especially in certain foreign hospitals—want of scrupulous attention 
    to ventilation, <span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and to cleanliness in wards, bedding, clothing, utensils, and 
    patients, and in the clothing and personal habits of attendants.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>In short, the entire result of this enquiry may be summed
up, in a very few words, as follows:—A woman in ordinary
health, and subject to the ordinary social conditions of her
station, will not, if delivered at home, be exposed to any
special disadvantages likely to diminish materially her
chance of recovery. But this same woman, if received into
an ordinary lying-in ward, together with others in the
puerperal state, will from that very fact become subject to
risks not necessarily incident to this state. These risks in
lying-in institutions may no doubt be materially diminished
by providing proper hospital accommodation, and by care,
common sense, and good management. And hence the real
practical question is, whether it is possible to ensure at all
times the observance of these conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great mortality in lying-in hospitals everywhere is
no doubt a strong argument against such a result being
attainable; so much so that, in the absence of this security,
the evidence in the preceding pages appears sufficient to
warrant the question being raised, whether lying-in hospitals,
arranged and managed as they are at present, should not be
forthwith closed?</p>

<p class='c007'>Can any supposed advantages to individual cases of destitution
counterbalance the enormous destruction of human
life shown by the statistics?</p>

<p class='c007'>Without vouching for the entire accuracy of Le Fort’s
data, they may still be taken generally as showing approximately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>the penalty which is being paid for the supposed
advantages of these institutions. It is this: (see Table XV.)
for every two women who would die if delivered at home,
fifteen must die if delivered in lying-in hospitals. Any
reasonable deduction from this death-rate for supposed
inaccuracy will not materially influence the result.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence is entirely in favour of home delivery, and
of making better provision in future for this arrangement
among the destitute poor.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>CAN THE ARRANGEMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF LYING-IN INSTITUTIONS BE IMPROVED?</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>Must we, then, surrender the principle of lying-in institutions
altogether, and limit the teaching of midwifery nurses
solely to bedside cases at home, notwithstanding the well-known
difficulties of teaching pupils at the beginning of
their course elsewhere than in an institution? We will try
to reply to this question; and, in doing so, perhaps some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>light may be thrown on another question, viz.: how to improve
existing lying-in establishments so as to reduce the
mortality in them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evidence sufficient has been collected to show that no one
panacea will enable us either to possess a perfectly healthy
building, or to improve existing hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much has been written about the saving effect of small
hospitals; but it is certain, from what has been already said,
that the small-hospital idea is not sufficient of itself. It is,
however, a very important idea, because all hospital problems
are simplified by subdivision of the buildings. So far
as we know, every one who has carefully studied the subject
has given a preference to small lying-in establishments over
large ones; but we should certainly be disappointed if we
trusted to smallness of size alone for reducing the mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evidence further shows that in any new plan infirmary
wards must be kept quite detached from lying-in
wards. They should be in another part of the ground, and
should be provided with their own furniture, bedding,
utensils, stores, kitchen, and attendants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same arrangement, at least in principle, should be
carried out at all existing lying-in establishments, and every
case of disease should at once be removed from the lying-in
wards to the infirmary, and be separately attended there.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our proposed midwifery school the whole attendance
would be supplied by midwives and pupil midwives, with a
physician accoucheur, to make his visit twice a day, to be
sent for in time of need, and to give instruction to the pupil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>midwives by lectures and otherwise; and in this way we
should escape the dangers of introducing medical students.</p>

<p class='c007'>Applying the same principle to lying-in wards to which
medical students are admitted, there can be no doubt that a
responsibility of the very gravest kind attaches to all
teachers and managers of lying-in hospitals who do not
satisfy themselves that students admitted as pupils have
nothing to do, either with general hospital practice, or with
anatomical schools, during the period. Midwifery instruction
should be treated as a matter quite apart.</p>

<p class='c007'>What has been already said need scarcely be repeated,
about the dangers of connecting midwifery wards with
general hospitals. The simple facts are sufficient to show
that all midwifery wards of this class should be at once
closed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a general result of this enquiry, applicable to all lying-in
wards, the evidence shows that very much indeed of the
success depends on good and intelligent administration and
management.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suppose that all these precautions could be carried out,
will the cost and difficulty of giving effect to them necessarily
lead to the abolition of all accommodation for midwifery
cases, or for teaching midwifery?</p>

<p class='c007'>We reply, No. The facts already adduced clearly show
what may be done in this matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>They prove, in the first place, that lying-in women should,
as a rule, be delivered at home. And, as a consequence,
that whatever provision may be made for cases of special
destitution, or for midwifery teaching, such provision should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>be assimilated as far as practicable to the conditions which
surround lying-in women in fairly comfortable homes.</p>

<p class='c007'>These conditions are realised, and in some instances no
doubt improved on, in the better class of workhouse lying-in
wards, and of lying-in huts for soldiers’ wives.</p>

<p class='c007'>The favourable results arrived at in many of these institutions
appear to show that a little more care would lower
the death-rate still further.</p>

<p class='c007'>In every instance where it is considered necessary to
organise lying-in accommodation by voluntary effort, the
same principles should be kept in view.</p>

<p class='c007'>The success which has attended Waterford Lying-in Hospital,
already mentioned, shows how much may be done in
rendering such accommodation a real boon to the poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>A single hut, like the Colchester Hut, erected in a needy
locality, would supply, and that safely, all the accommodation
wanted. But for a training school of midwives and
midwifery nurses other accommodation is required, and of
a far more costly character.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is true that any sort of building may be leased or
bought and altered, or added to, and told off as a training
school; but after what has been said, to take such a course
would be to ensure killing a certain number of mothers for
the sake of training a certain number of midwives. If we
are to have a training school at all, we must, before all
things, make it as safe for lying-in women to enter it as to
be delivered at home; and having made up our minds what
is necessary for this purpose, we must pay for it.</p>

  <h2 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='c032'><i>CONSTRUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF A LYING-IN INSTITUTION AND TRAINING SCHOOL FOR MIDWIVES AND MIDWIFERY NURSES.</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>To apply all this experience to the construction and
organisation of a school for midwives and midwifery
nurses<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c009'><sup>[20]</sup></a> is the next thing:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Everybody must be born, and every woman, at least in
this kingdom, is attended at the birth of her child by somebody,
skilful or unskilful. Except in the case of multiple
births, there are therefore as many attendances as there
are births in the Returns of the Registrars-General.</p>

<p class='c007'>This it is which makes the subject of midwifery nursing
of such paramount importance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lying-in is an operation which occurs in England to seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>women out of a hundred annually. In 1868 there were
786,858 children born alive in this country, wherefore for the
midwives and midwifery nurses to be trained there will
always be occupation and custom enough; whereas the
occupation and custom for a surgical operator is, it is to be
hoped, comparatively small, except in Franco-German wars.
Even there we may trust that 7 out of 100 had not to
undergo an operation. Certainly to 7 out of every 100
annually a surgical operation in England does not occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between midwifery nursing and all other hospital
nursing there is this distinction, viz.: the operator is herself
the nurse; and the head-operator (or midwife) ought to
be a woman, and <i>is</i>, in Paris and Vienna, and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lying-in patients are to be compared to surgical (or
operation) patients, <i>not</i> to medical patients, and <i>should</i> be
perfectly well in health.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since lying-in is not an illness, and lying-in cases are not
<i>sick</i> cases, it would be well, as already said, to get rid of
the word ‘hospital’ altogether, and never use the word in
juxtaposition with lying-in women, as lying-in women should
never be in juxtaposition with any infirmary cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to amount of work, necessary administrative conveniences
and the like, a lying-in institution is to be compared
to a surgical, <i>not</i> medical hospital, or rather to a
hospital for operations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been already shown that great improvements are
required in the manner of keeping midwifery statistics, and
that many data are wanting for this purpose. It would be
altogether wrong to deal with these statistics on the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>principles as if they were general hospital statistics. Lying-in
is neither a disease nor an accident, and any fatality
attending it is not to be counted as so much per cent. of inevitable
loss. On the contrary, a death in childbed is almost a
subject for an inquest. It is nothing short of a calamity
which it is right that we should know all about, to avoid it
in future. A form of record is appended (Table XVI.),
which appears to afford the means of registering the required
information.</p>

<h3 class='c026'>I. <i>CONSTRUCTION OF A LYING-IN INSTITUTION.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>What then, first, should be the principles of construction
for a lying-in institution, in order to combine safety for the
lying-in women with opportunity of training for the pupil
midwives? And,</p>

<h4 class='c033'>1. <i>How many Beds to a Ward?</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>Not more than four.</p>

<p class='c007'>Or single-bed wards might be arranged in groups of
four.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also, it must always be borne in mind that four beds
mean eight patients. There are two patients to each bed
(unless it is meant to kill the infants) to use up the air,
which is besides used up by a necessarily far larger number
of attendants than in any general hospital. For, during the
time the mother is incapable of attending to the infant, the
infant is incapable of attending to itself. Also, an exhausted
mother, and feeble, almost lifeless infant, cannot ring a bell
or make themselves heard. Indeed, an infant which cannot
cry is in the greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>For all this provision must be made. There are scarcely
two points in common between a lying-in institution and a
general hospital.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>2. <i>How many Wards to a Floor?</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>Only one four-bed ward, or four one-bed wards in a

<h4 class='c033'>3. <i>How many Floors to a Pavilion (hut or cottage)?</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>The <i>minimum</i> of ward cubic space for a lying-in woman,
even where the delivery ward is, as it ought always to be,
separate, is 2,300 cubic feet in a single-bed ward, and 1,900
cubic feet in a four-bed ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>[In ordinary army wooden huts, where the air comes in
at every seam, this space may be less.]</p>

<p class='c007'>As it is a principle that superficial area signifies more
than cubic space, the surface of floor for each bed should
not be less than 150 square feet per bed in a four-bed ward,
and in a single-bed ward not less than 190 square feet,
because this is the total available space for all purposes in
a single-bed ward. This space has to be occupied, not
only by the lying-in woman and her infant, and perhaps
a pupil midwife washing and dressing it at the fire, but
often by the midwife, an assistant, possibly the medical
officer, and pupil midwives. In a four-bed ward there is
space common to all the beds.</p>

<h4 class='c033'><i>The Delivery Ward.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>Ought to be separate in every lying-in institution; <i>must</i> be
separate in an institution of more than four or five beds,
though in separate compartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every delivery bed should have a superficial area of not
less than 200 square feet, and a cubic space of not less than
2,400 cubic feet.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h4 class='c033'>5. <i>How many Windows to a Bed?</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c027'>One at least to each bed. Two beds and two windows
on each side of the four-bed ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a single-bed ward the bed should not be placed
directly between window and door. And it must never be
in an angle. There must be room for attendants on both
sides the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is still more essential in a delivery ward. Each bed
should be lighted on <i>both</i> sides by windows, and should have
at least five feet of passage room on either side.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>6. <i>What are healthy Walls and Ceilings and Floors?</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>Oak floors, polished; furniture also; impervious glazed
walls and ceilings, or frequent lime-washing.</p>

<p class='c007'>All that has been so justly said as to the necessity of impervious
polished floors and walls for hospitals applies tenfold
to lying-in institutions, where the decomposition of dead
organic matter, and the re-composition of new organic
matter, must be constantly going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this, in fact, which makes lying-in institutions so
dangerous to the inmates.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it may literally be said that the danger increases
as the square of the number of in cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lying-in ‘infection’ is a very good illustration of what
‘infection’ really means, since <i>parturition</i> is not infectious or
‘contagious.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The excessive susceptibility of lying-in women to poisonous
emanations, the excessively poisonous emanations from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>lying-in women—these constitute a hospital influence on
lying-in cases brought together in institutions, second to no
influence we know of exercised by the most ‘infectious’ or
‘contagious’ disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death-rate is not much higher among women lying-in
at home in large towns than in healthy districts. Therefore
the agglomeration of cases together and want of
management required to meet it must bear the blame.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to floors, the well-laid polished floor is <i><span lang="la">a sine quâ non</span></i>
in a lying-in institution, where, with every care, slops,
blood, and the like, must frequently be spilt on the floor.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>7. <i>What is a healthy and well-lighted Delivery Ward?</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>There must be two separate delivery wards for each
floor of the whole lying-in institution, so arranged and
connected <i>under cover</i> that the lying-in women may be
removed after delivery to their own ward. And for this
purpose the corridors must admit of being warmed during
winter, especially at night, so as to be of a tolerably equable
temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unlimited hot and cold water laid on, day and night,
W.C. sink, bath-sink, clean linen, must be close at hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a pavilion hospital one single-bed ward should be
attached to each delivery ward, for an exhausted case after
delivery, till she is able to be moved to her own ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delivery ward should be so lighted and arranged
that it can be divided, by curtains only, into three if not
four compartments.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>No woman being delivered should see another delivery
going on at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The delivery bedsteads stand in their compartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each delivery bed should have window light on either
side, and also ample passage room all round and on both
sides the bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Care should be taken that no bed should stand exactly
between door and window, on account of draughts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The curtains, of washing material, are only just high
enough to exclude sight, not high enough to exclude light
or air, and are made so as to pull entirely back when not
wanted. Each area enclosed by the curtains should of
course be sufficiently ample for pupils, attendants, and
patient; also for a low truck on broad wheels covered
with india-rubber, to be brought in, on which the bedstead
with the clean warm bedclothes is placed, and the newly-delivered
woman conveyed to her own ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>[A woman very much exhausted would be carried in the
delivery bed to the bye-ward attached to each delivery
ward.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The reason why there must be two delivery wards for
each floor of a lying-in institution, to be used alternately,
one ‘off,’ one ‘on,’ is that one delivery ward on each floor
must be always vacant for thorough cleansing, lime-washing
and rest for a given period, say month and month about.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is understood that newly-delivered women cannot be
removed from one floor to another. And it is quite
necessary to have the means of keeping a corridor, along
which a newly-delivered woman is to be moved, at a proper
temperature.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The position of the delivery wards should be as nearly as
possible equidistant from the lying-in wards, and should be
such that the women in labour, on their way to the delivery
ward, need not to pass the doors of other wards.</p>

<p class='c007'>A separate scullery to each delivery ward is indispensable;
such scullery to be on at least an equal scale to that of
ward sculleries. Hot and cold water to be constantly at
hand, night and day. A sink-bath is desirable for immediately
putting in water soiled linen from the beds and the
like.</p>

<p class='c007'>The scullery should contain a linen-press, small range
with oven, hot closet at side of the fire-place, sink with hot
and cold water, &#38;c. A small compartment should contain a
slop-sink for emptying and cleansing bed-pans, and a sink
about six inches deep and sunk below the floor, which is
intended for filling and emptying a portable bath, and
which when not required for this might be used for
soaking linen, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the scullery, so as to be as far removed as may
be from the traffic of the main corridor and the noises of
the delivery ward, should be the bye-ward, with not less
than 2,100 cubic feet of contents.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>8. <i>Scullery, Lavatory, W.C.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>The necessary consumption of hot and cold water is at
least double or triple that of any general hospital. Sinks
and W.C. sinks must be everywhere conveniently situated.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be a scullery to each four beds; the scullery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>must needs be much larger and more convenient than in a
general hospital. There is often more work to be done by
night than by day in a lying-in institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the ward appurtenances, scullery, lavatory, &#38;c., must
stand empty for thorough cleansing, when the ward to
which they belong stands empty in rotation for this purpose,
and must not be used for any other ward. For each four-bed
ward, or group of four one-bed wards, or for each floor
of each pavilion, there must therefore be one scullery, with
a plentiful unfailing supply of hot and cold water, with sinks
and every convenience. The reason for this is two-fold:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) To allow each scullery, with the other ward offices, to
be thoroughly cleansed and whitewashed with its own
group of four beds.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) The work in a scullery and in all the other ward
appurtenances day and night, night and day, is many-fold
that which it is in a general hospital scullery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this, general hospital patients ought never to be
allowed to enter the scullery.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a lying-in scullery the infants, most exacting of all
patients, must frequently be in the scullery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even under the very best circumstances there are
many lying-in cases among weakly women where the
mother’s state is such as to render it necessary for a ‘crying’
infant to be washed and dressed elsewhere than in its
mother’s ward. These infants are best washed, in that case,
in the scullery, which must be so arranged that infants
can be washed and dressed without being exposed to a
thorough draught, and that nurses and babies may not be
hustling one another.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>There must be a good press in each scullery. A supply
of clean linen and other necessaries will have to be kept
in each press in each scullery.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slop-sink and other appurtenances must be arranged
so as to make allowance for the fact that the going backwards
and forwards for water, hot and cold, or to empty
slops in a lying-in institution—where half the patients can do
nothing for themselves, and the other half (the mothers) are
supposed to be ready for discharge when they can go to
the ward offices for themselves—is more than it is in general
hospitals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fixed baths are not necessary. But there must be means
for filling with hot water moveable infants’ baths at all
hours at a moment’s notice, since an infant’s life often
depends on immediate facility of hot-water bathing.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this besides the daily regular night and morning
washing of infants.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be also a moveable bath for each ward for
the lying-in women, with the means for supplying it with
hot and cold water and for emptying it. Lying-in patients
are not able to use either fixed baths or lavatory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Glazed earthenware sinks should alone be used, as being
by far the safest and cleanest.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>9. <i>How to Ventilate Lying-in Wards.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>The best ventilation is from opposite windows. Each
window should be in three parts, the third or uppermost to
consist of a flap hung on hinges to open inwards and throw
the air from without upwards.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Inlet valves, to admit fresh air, and outlet shafts, to emit
foul air, must be added to complete the natural ventilation.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>10. <i>Furniture, Bedding, Linen.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>As little ward furniture as possible. As much clean linen
as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very large and convenient clean linen-store, light and
dry, must be assigned to the matron: very much larger than
would be required for a general hospital; but no general
hospital in London supplies a good standard for such.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be in each scullery, besides, a clean linen-press.</p>

<p class='c007'>There should be a very ample and convenient place for
bedding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mattresses, blankets and the like, have to be renewed,
taken to pieces and washed—especially those used in the
delivery ward—many times oftener than in any general
hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rack for linen should be along the middle of the linen-store.</p>

<p class='c007'>There should be space for a bedding-rack along one end,
taking about three feet six inches from the length of
the room for linen. Space for some spare mattresses and
bolsters will be necessary; and they should be stowed near
to a lift.</p>

<p class='c007'>A linen-store requires thorough lighting, ventilating, and
warming. Three windows are better than one. The linen
must of course be kept dry and aired.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>
  <h4 class='c033'>11. <i>Water Supply, Drainage, Washing.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Unlimited hot and cold water supply, day and night,
should be laid on all over the buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>All drains and sewers must be kept outside the walls of
the buildings, and great care should be bestowed on trapping
and ventilating them, to prevent foul air passing into the
institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The washing in a lying-in institution is, it need not be
said, very large, and should be conducted quite at a distance.
Sink-baths, for immediately putting in water soiled linen, are
necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>12. <i>Medical Officer’s Room and Waiting-room.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>No dispensary, especially no dispenser, is needed in a
lying-in institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>A medical officer’s room is necessary. The medical officer
is not resident. He makes his morning and evening visit, and
is called in by the head midwife for any difficult case. He
gives instruction, scientific and practical, to the pupil midwives.
[These lectures are given in the pupil midwives’
mess-room.]</p>

<p class='c007'>In the medical officer’s room should be kept the instruments,
to which a fully qualified head midwife also has a
key. The medical officer keeps the notes of cases, &#38;c., and
of instruction to the pupil midwives in this room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The few, very few, drugs needed in a good lying-in institution
are kept here, or in the head midwife’s sitting-room.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>A waiting-room is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be a room where the head midwife can
examine a woman, to know if labour is imminent.</p>

<p class='c007'>This might be done in the medical officer’s room or the
waiting-room.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>13. <i>Segregation Ward.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>A ward is unfortunately necessary, completely isolated,
where a sick case, brought in with small-pox or erysipelas
or the like, could be delivered and entirely separated from
the others, or where a case of puerperal fever or peritonitis
(though such ought never to arise after delivery in a properly
constructed and managed institution) could be transferred.
But if, unfortunately, puerperal fever should appear in the
hospital, no new admissions should be allowed until the
buildings have been thoroughly cleansed, lime-washed, and
aired.</p>

<p class='c007'>The segregation ward must have a nurse’s room, and a
provision of sink, slop-sink, &#38;c.</p>

<h4 class='c033'>14. <i>Kitchen.</i></h4>

<p class='c027'>The kitchen should be well placed, conveniently near, yet
sufficiently cut off from the main corridor by a neck of passage
and intermediate offices.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>SITE.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>The site of a lying-in institution must be open, airy, surrounded
with its own grounds, not adjoining or near to any
other building, still less to any hospital or any nuisance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>or source of miasm. But it must be in the immediate
vicinity of any large centre of population from which the
lying-in women come.</p>

<p class='c007'>And this involves the question of receiving-rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should there be a receiving-room, as well as a waiting-room?</p>

<p class='c007'>The lying-in woman’s name is put down for admission
some time beforehand.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lying-in hospitals differ as to their rules whether or no to
admit women any time before labour is imminent. If they
are not so admitted, they often have to be sent back again
home.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is now believed to be the soundest principle that the
fewer days a lying-in woman spends in a lying-in institution,
beyond the time she is actually under treatment, the better;
and this involves that she should not be admitted till labour
is imminent—even at the risk of the infant being born in
cab or lift (which <i>has</i> happened).</p>

<p class='c007'>Lying-in institutions must (unfortunately) be, therefore,
in the immediate neighbourhood of great towns or centres
of population.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Even those London Boards which are building their
excellent new workhouse infirmaries in the country, are
forced to keep their lying-in wards in the old workhouses in
the town.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The difference, however, as has been shown by our
statistics, is not so great between the mortality of women
lying-in at home in the country and in the town as should
make us pronounce against lying-in institutions in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>centres of population—provided they have a large and
entirely isolated area completely to themselves, perhaps a
proportion of two acres to fifty beds.</p>

<p class='c007'>But this involves another question.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large proportion, alas! of workhouse lying-in women
(we have seen two-thirds at Liverpool<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c009'><sup>[21]</sup></a>) are unmarried. Of
these many have no home.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to send these women back again, even if
labour is not actually imminent. And it is impossible to
send them out after delivery, till recovery is fairly confirmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>In workhouses the question is solved by women being
admitted into the body of the house during pregnancy, and
discharged into the body of the house, if not to their own
homes, when quite convalescent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Liverpool Workhouse fourteen days after labour the
lying-in women are thus discharged. Fourteen, eighteen,
twenty-one days, are the average of a woman’s stay in the
lying-in division in London workhouses.</p>

<p class='c007'>A soldiers’ wives’ hospital takes in no unmarried women
to lie-in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Civil lying-in institutions almost invariably have to make
exceptions and take in unmarried women.</p>

<p class='c007'>In workhouses they are not the exception, they are the
rule. Married women are the exception.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be observed that married women will rarely come
in an hour before, or stay an hour after it is necessary, in
any lying-in institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ten to twelve days is ‘the average period of hospital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>treatment’ in Colchester, Woolwich, and other soldiers’
wives’ lying-in hospitals. ‘Women of this station of life
cannot, as a rule, be prevailed upon to submit to longer
detention,’ it is added.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average number of days in King’s College Hospital
lying-in ward was sixteen. None were permitted to leave
under fourteen days. Twenty-one days were <i>allowed</i>, in
ordinary cases. It is feared this might be too long; but so
very many weakly, half-starved women sought admission,
that to send some away sooner was ‘to ensure a breakdown,’
it is stated.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a civil lying-in institution it would not be by any
means desirable absolutely to exclude single young women
<i>primiparæ</i>; it would be grievous to some of these poor
things to be sent among the (often hardened) wretched
women of the workhouse. The whole question of these
poor young women—unmarried mothers of a first child—is
full of difficulty. It would never do, morally, to make
special provision for them. And for this very reason we
seem bound to receive such, conditionally, into well regulated
lying-in institutions, and afford some kindly care to
prevent, at the very least, their sinking lower. But it
would not be right to leave any admissions for single
women in the hands of any young assistant, or morally
inexperienced person.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle appears to be that, if pregnant women
are to be received some time before and kept some time
after delivery, the excess of time should not be passed in
the lying-in wards, but in separate accommodation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h3 class='c026'>II. <i>MANAGEMENT.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c027'>Construction, however, in a lying-in institution, holds
only the second place to good management in determining
whether the lying-in patients shall live or die. And without
such management, no construction, however perfect, will
avail.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the first elementary principle of good management is
to have always one pavilion of four or eight beds, according
as it is of one floor or of two, standing empty in rotation
for purposes of thorough cleansing. <i>A fortiori</i>—one
delivery pavilion on each floor is always to be vacant
alternately.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pavilion to be in rotation unoccupied for the purposes
of cleansing must necessarily be the <i>whole</i> pavilion, with all
its sculleries and ward offices, since the process of cleansing
is—turning out all the little furniture a lying-in ward ought
ever to possess, bringing in lime-washers, possibly scrapers
and painters, leaving doors and windows open all day, and
even all night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every reason for having each ordinary pavilion ward
completely separate, and individually <i>pavilionised</i>, applies
with tenfold force to the delivery ward. Each must be
complete in itself, with all its appurtenances and bye-ward
for extreme cases, as a little pavilion. There is no possibility
for properly cleansing and lime-washing the delivery
ward <i>not</i> in use, unless this be the case.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>One</i> delivery ward, however spacious and well arranged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span><i>constantly</i> used, would be a centre of deplorable mischief
for the whole institution. This makes <i>two</i> delivery wards
for each floor of the institution indispensable, to be used
alternately for the whole floor at given periods.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>N.B.</i> Liverpool Workhouse with 25 lying-in beds, exclusive
of delivery beds, has had an average of 500 deliveries
<i>a year</i> for eleven years. A civil lying-in hospital
in or near a large town is generally <i>just as full as it is
permitted</i> to be. Five or six hundred deliveries or more <i>a
year</i> might be reckoned upon; occasionally three or four
deliveries a night. Sculleries will be <i>always</i> in use, <i>day and
night</i>. All this renders it imperative that an inexorable
rule should be made and kept to, viz. that every lying-in
pavilion should be vacant in rotation, each delivery pavilion
alternately, for thorough cleansing.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second elementary principle of good management
is to remove every case of <i>illness</i> arising in the institution,
and every such case admitted into the institution, at once to
an isolated sick ward or infirmary ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is <i>must</i>, not may.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though we should have no puerperal fever or peritonitis
in a building of this <i>make</i>, yet unfortunately other institutions
will send in (say) erysipelas or small-pox patients
seized with labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sad experience tells that this unprincipled practice has
often proved fatal to many other inmates of the lying-in
institution, turning an institution into a hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every sick case should therefore be completely isolated, in
a separate sick ward, from the lying-in women. And if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>admitted before delivery, her delivery should take place in
this separate ward.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>N.B.</i> The nurse’s dinner and meals may be prepared in
the general kitchen and sent to her. The patient’s arrowroot,
gruel, &#38;c., must be made, and her beef-tea warmed, in
the ‘sick or segregation’ building, and all linen must be
sent to the ward well aired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it desirable to connect the ‘segregation’ ward by any
covered passage with the rest of the lying-in institution?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is much to be said for and against.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ward, it is to be hoped, will not often have to be
used at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>But small-pox has appeared after labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>There might be danger in taking a patient from the
institution to this ward through the open air, in all weathers,
unprotected by any covered passage.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, when once the patient is in the ward,
complete isolation is by far the best, for the sake of all the
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there is by no means the same necessity for a
passage as in the other parts of the institution where any
night there may be three or four ordinary delivery cases to
be conveyed through the passages.</p>

<p class='c007'>A covered ambulance for sick cases is not, however, a nice
thing, though often suggested.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c009'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>3. The first two may be called universal and essential
principles of good management in every lying-in institution,
large or small, however perfectly constructed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a third, hardly less essential, wherever there is
more than one bed to a ward, viz. to remove a lying-in
woman three times during her stay in the institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average course of an ordinary case may be reckoned
thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Seven or eight hours in the delivery ward.</div>
      <div class='line'>Five or six days in the lying-in ward.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nine or ten days in the convalescent ward.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The nearer wards to the delivery ward in use should
always be made the wards for women immediately after
delivery; the farther wards for the same women when
removed for their convalescent stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a single-bed ward the woman may remain in her
own ward from after her delivery till her discharge; that
is, no further removal after her delivery is necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Cases of extreme exhaustion after delivery, which are
better out of the delivery ward yet cannot be moved many
yards, should be carried <i>in their beds</i> to the bye-ward
adjoining the delivery ward, till they are somewhat recovered.</p>

<p class='c007'>These must have a constant watcher by them.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. In a lying-in institution about three times the quantity
of linen and bedding for each patient is necessary of
what is used at a general hospital.</p>

<p class='c007'>The day’s and night’s provision of linen is kept in each
ward scullery, and in the scullery of each delivery ward in
use.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The linen-store in the store-room, and the bedding-store,
need to be very complete and ample.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bedding, that is, the mattress and blankets, of any one
bed in the delivery ward should not be used for more than
three or four delivery cases in succession without undergoing
some process of purification—and this quite independent of
any accident, the mattress of course being protected by
Macintosh sheeting.</p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>III. TRAINING SCHOOL FOR MIDWIVES.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>The few words which will here be added on the management
of a midwifery training school are not at all to be
understood as a manual for practical instruction, which it is
quite impossible to introduce here, but as simply treating of
the management, in so far as this determines some constructive
arrangements as imperative, and others as to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>No charity or institution, I believe, could possibly bear
the expense of a single-bed ward, or even of a four-bed ward
lying-in establishment, for a pretty constant succession of
thirty-two patients, unless there were a training school.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Thirty-two single-bed wards, an administrator would say,
would require sixteen nurses, independently of midwives!!]</p>

<p class='c007'>Even with a training school, the first year would be one
of great difficulty, since all well managed training schools
‘take in’ pupils as much as possible at only two periods of
the year, so as never to have the whole of the pupils fresh
hands at once. But the <i>first</i> batch must necessarily be all
fresh hands. A raw girl cannot be turned in to sit up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a newly-delivered woman and new-born infant. And a
midwife cannot be spared to each girl all to herself, to
teach her how to handle an infant. [That is, in each single-bed
ward.]</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole nursing service of a large four-bed or one-bed
ward lying-in institution is so complicated, so different from
that of a general hospital with its 20 or 32–bed wards, that
it is difficult to provide for.</p>

<p class='c007'>In even guessing at what the nursing accommodation
should be for so completely new an experiment as a lying-in
institution of 40 beds in single-bed or four-bed pavilions,
we must begin by stating the probable requirements, the
whole being tentative.</p>

<p class='c007'>The staff would have to be at least as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>One matron.</p>

<p class='c007'>One head midwife.</p>

<p class='c007'>One assistant midwife.</p>

<p class='c007'>One deputy assistant midwife (for the first year).</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>To establish a really good training school,</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Thirty pupil midwives.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Two experienced good nurses in addition might be necessary
for the first year.]</p>

<p class='c007'>One cook.</p>

<p class='c007'>One housemaid.</p>

<p class='c007'>One or two other female servants, such as scourers—or
more (number required depending on the flooring used).</p>

<p class='c007'>Though this staff appears enormous, it is calculated upon
the plan of giving only one night nurse to every four beds,—upon
the supposition that 32 occupied beds will give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>constant succession of cases, enough to provide instruction
for almost as many pupil midwives;—upon the principle that
for systematic instruction there must be a fair number of
pupils; as, if every moment of their time is occupied in active
duties, they cannot be well trained;—and also upon the
obvious fact that it would be impossible, from its extravagance,
to nurse such a construction without pupils.</p>

<p class='c007'>[For the <i>second</i> year, if a portion of the pupils are to be
made thorough midwives, and their time of training two
years, possibly the deputy assistant midwife, and probably
both the nurses, might be dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second-year pupil midwives ought to be quite competent,
each to be in charge of two or three first-year’s
pupils and several patients, taking these patients from the
beginning, and teaching pupils to handle new-born infants,
look after ordinary lying-in cases, and the like; and most
excellent practice it is for the young teachers.]</p>

<p class='c007'>As to scourers, the nature of the floors decided upon will
determine what are wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Also, none of the midwives can be expected to be housemaids,
even in their own rooms. They have too much
to do. The pupil midwives would be expected to clean
their own bed rooms, but not to scour, either for the patients
or for themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be a common room for pupil midwives.
Here they take their meals in detachments. Head midwife,
as a rule, with first detachment; matron carving. Here
they receive lectures and instruction from the physician
accoucheur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The matron must have two rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The head midwife may have two rooms. She will expect
to have her tea in her own room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head midwife, her assistants, and all her staff, should
be lodged in a central position, and there should be ready
means of communication with these quarters, both by bells
and speaking tubes, from each pavilion and delivery ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>A regular night service in a lying-in institution being impossible,
the head midwife, when she goes her last round at
night, say between eleven and twelve <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, stations other
watchers for any emergency arising besides those now to be
mentioned, who are for the night nursing of ordinary cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this one pupil would probably be told off for each
four wards or beds, and one extra for the whole floor, who
must not be an inexperienced pupil. Her duty would be
to visit each pavilion on her floor, and to have all in readiness
in the delivery ward for cases coming in at night—a not
infrequent occurrence.</p>

<p class='c007'>The head midwife would also arrange for the special care
of any critical case at once, on the patient being conveyed
to her own ward, or to that adjacent to the delivery ward.</p>

<p class='c007'>In so large and therefore busy a lying-in institution, it
would not be desirable to call up all the pupil midwives to
every case coming in the night. They would be appointed
day by day alternately, and the number told off for the
purpose would be called to any case coming <i>that</i> night.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is therefore most desirable that the sleeping-rooms or
compartments (each with its own window) of the pupil
midwives should be arranged in at least three reliefs, so that
the occupants of one dormitory, or relief, could be called by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>a bell from the delivery ward ringing into that dormitory
without needlessly disturbing others.</p>

<p class='c007'>In so large an institution the head midwife even cannot
attend every night case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The assistant must be a well qualified midwife, who can
take her turn in attending night cases, calling the head
midwife if necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Through all this organization, however, as far as possible,
each pupil is told off to be in charge of a mother and infant
from beginning to end.</p>

<p class='c007'>And there will always be unfortunately a certain number
of cases, each requiring a nurse constantly by her side
day and night.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is obvious that the same woman cannot do this for a
succession of days and nights.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the number of severe cases requiring it would unquestionably
be much smaller in a single-bed ward hospital, or
in a four-bed ward hut hospital, because of its superior immunity
from puerperal disease; though, from the single-bed
ward condition, every such case will require a nurse all to
itself. And the same nurse cannot be always sitting up day
and night.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>N.B.</i> Repetitions may possibly here be pardoned. The
pupil midwife appointed as night watcher for the whole
floor cannot be depended upon to attend the bell of any individual
watcher. She may be absent at a delivery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet the life of an infant, <i>e.g.</i>, in convulsions, depends on
minutes—on the watcher being able to summon immediate
help, hot water for a bath, and the like.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Those appointed to be called in such emergency should
therefore be readily communicated with by bells or otherwise,
without disturbing others, either nurses or patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>As there are no sleeping-rooms for any midwife or pupil
in the ward pavilions, it is necessary to insist upon this—that
there should be every facility for their being rung up
or called up at night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every pupil midwife ought to have a little bedroom to
herself, or at least a compartment with half a window, or
better a whole window, to itself. There should be a bathroom
and W.C. on each floor in the pupil nurses’ quarters,
and a back staircase.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a small sickroom could be managed for pupil midwives,
it would be advisable. Where there are so many,
one may be attacked with bronchitis or with scarlatina.
She could not, of course, be ‘warded’ with the lying-in
women; and it might be undesirable to leave her in her
own little room, though this is quite sufficient for any slight
illness. The top floor, as securing greater quiet, and a
certain degree of isolation, might be the best for this sickroom.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of the pupil midwives’ quarters should have
direct and ready means of communication with the hospital
proper. Each relief should be independent of the other
two, and under the immediate supervision of the official
woman, whose quarters are attached to its own.</p>

<p class='c007'>It need scarcely be stated that an essential part of a Pupil
Midwife’s training is to attend lying-in women at their own
homes, with the conveniences or rather the inconveniences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>of those homes. Otherwise the Pupil will be the less fit for
her after-work. The last two months of every six might
well be given to this. But, as above said, these ‘Notes’
about management, for they are nothing more, simply treat
of it as regards construction, and do not refer to the necessary
training, either in-door or outdoor, at all.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c009'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c026'><i>DESCRIPTION OF SKETCH-PLANS OF PROPOSED INSTITUTION.</i></h3>

<p class='c027'>I know of no single building which requires more ingenuity
to plan, and has hitherto received less, than a lying-in
institution, especially with a training school for midwives
attached.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieut. Ommanney, R.E., has been kind enough to give
his time and mind to the subject—having previously had
considerable experience at the War Office in planning female
hospitals—and to embody the whole of the working accommodation
required for both lying-in institution and school in the
thoughtfully arranged sketch-plans, Nos. III., IV., and V.</p>

<p class='c007'>The estimated cost of these plans is large; but if we must
have lying-in institutions at all, it is only ‘penny wise and
pound foolish’ to cripple either space or necessary appliances,
or the means of regularly and periodically vacating
every ward and every ward-office destined for the use of
lying-in women.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>
  <h4 class='c033'><span class='sc'>Plan III.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c027'>This plan shows a lying-in ward unit for the institution,
together with its scullery and separate offices, and the relation
which these bear to the corridor of communication
joining all parts of the hospital on each floor together.</p>

<p class='c007'>The measurements and other details shown on this plan
are the result of repeated and careful consideration of the
requirements already described; and it is believed that in
practice they would be found sufficient for every purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>The four beds shown on it are not the <i>minimum</i>, but the
<i>maximum</i> number which, judging from all past experience,
could be safely placed together.</p>

<h4 class='c033'><span class='sc'>Plan IV.</span></h4>

<p class='c027'>Shows a floor of one of the lying-in ward pavilions,
divided into four separate one-bed rooms. This plan
also represents a unit, but of another construction. The
great advantage of the arrangement is complete separation
of cases from each other, so that each room is as far as possible
assimilated to a room in a private dwelling-house. To
obtain this advantage the rooms are arranged in pairs on
each side of a nine-feet passage, having a window at one
end and a corridor-window opposite the other end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two of the rooms open from the corridor, and two
rooms from the passage, but the doors are not opposite each
other. In this, as in the four-bed ward plan, the scullery and
offices are completely isolated from the rooms by a nine-feet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>corridor. In this case, also, the measurements and other
details have been arrived at after full consideration. This
plan would be somewhat more costly than the previous one
(Plan III.). The justification of it is found in the fact that
it reproduces, in a permanent form, the conditions in
Colchester Lying-in Hut, already described. And in this
hut there has, as yet, been no death after delivery.</p>

<h4 class='c033'><span class='sc'>Plan V.</span></h4>

<p class='c035'><i>A lying-in institution for forty beds (thirty-two to thirty-six
occupied), with a training school for thirty pupil midwives
and midwifery nurses.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>This plan gives a sketch of an arrangement of pavilions,
offices, quarters, &#38;c., forming a complete lying-in institution
and training school. As already stated, such an institution
must, from its very objects, be situated in a town where land
is scarce and valuable, and this is a chief difficulty in
erecting it. Hence it has been necessary to keep the different
parts as close together as possible, and yet not to
crowd them so as to interfere injuriously with the external
ventilation. The mere architecture, as will be seen, has been
subordinated to this necessity, but it must be borne in mind
that utility, and not architectural effect, is to be sought
for.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the centre of the plan project the quarters for pupils,
on three floors, ten quarters on each floor. They are arranged
in this way to enable the reliefs to be taken from one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>floor at a time. Behind these, in the same block, are
quarters for matron and midwives, waiting-room, surgery,
stores, kitchen, and pupils’ dining-room. The general entrance
is in one side of the centre block. The two front
pavilions, on either side the centre, contain the delivery
wards, two on each floor. Each delivery pavilion contains
a ward for three beds on each floor, with its bye-ward and
offices. Only one delivery pavilion will be in use at one
time. While one pavilion is in use, the other will be vacant,
and undergoing ventilation and cleansing. These delivery wards
are connected with the centre, and with all the
pavilions on each floor by a nine-feet corridor, with crosslight
and ventilation. Fire-places are shown for warming
in winter. On the ground floor are three four-bed wards,
with offices, on each side, on the construction shown on
Plan III. There will thus be twenty-four lying-in beds, and
six delivery beds (but three delivery beds and 20 lying-in
beds only in use at the same time) on the ground floor. The
second pavilion from the front, on each side, is only one
storey in height, so as to afford a freer circulation of air among
the pavilions in the space within which it might be necessary
to place them.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a consequence of this arrangement there would be
only four lying-in wards, of four beds each, on the upper
floor, together with a delivery ward at each side (one delivery
ward to be used at a time).</p>

<p class='c007'>A special detached ward for febrile cases is shown
behind the building.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The total accommodation in an establishment of this size
would be sufficient for 6 simultaneous deliveries and 32 to
36 lying-in women. There would be 6 delivery beds
always resting, and 4 or 8 lying-in beds always unoccupied.
There would be training accommodation and facilities for 30
pupils.</p>

<h3 class='c033'><i>MIDWIFERY AS A CAREER FOR EDUCATED WOMEN.</i></h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c005'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>My dear Sisters</span> (or rather, Chers et très-honorés Confrères),</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>While all that we women think about is to have the same
education as men in medicine, must we not feel the women’s medical
movement to be rather barren when it might be so fruitful?</p>

<p class='c007'>But public opinion in England is not free enough for a coward
to dare to say what she thinks, unless at the risk of having her
head (figuratively) broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there not a much better thing for women than to be ‘medical
men,’ and that is to be <i>medical women</i>?</p>

<p class='c007'>Has not the cart been put before the horse in this women’s
medical movement?</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is a branch so entirely their own, that we may safely say
that no lying-in would be attended but by a woman if a woman
were as skilful as a man—a physician accoucheur.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, instead of the ladies turning all their attention to this,
and organising a midwifery school of the highest efficiency in both
science and practice, they enter men’s classes, and lectures, and
examinations, which don’t wish to have them, and say they want
the same education as men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, is there not an immense confusion as to whether they are
ever to be called in as medical attendants to men?</p>

<p class='c007'>‘No,’ say those lady doctors who have at all thought out the
question. ‘We wish to be educated as if we were going to attend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>men, but we should think it an insult to be called in to attend
men.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Why not adjourn for a century, or for half a century, the question
whether <i>all</i> branches of medical and surgical practice shall
be exercised by women, even upon women? It is a question
which may safely be left to settle itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>But here is a matter so pressing, so universal, so universally
recognised, viz., the preferable attendance of women upon women
in midwifery, that it may really be summed up thus:—Although
every woman would prefer a woman to attend upon her in her
lying-in, and in diseases peculiar to her and her children, yet the
woman does not exist, or hardly exists, to do it. Midwives are
so ignorant that it is almost a term of contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rich woman cannot find fully qualified women, but only
men to attend her, and the poor woman only takes unqualified
women because she cannot afford to pay well qualified men.</p>

<p class='c007'>But why should the midwives be ignorant? and why (in the
great movement that there is now to make women into medical
men) should not this branch, midwifery, which they will find no
one to contest against them—not at least in the estimation of the
patients—be the first ambition of cultivated women? Is there
any rational doubt that, suppose there were a man and a woman,
both equally versed in midwifery art and science, the woman
would be the one sent for by all lying-in women?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a better thing than making women into medical men,
and that is making them into medical <i>women</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely it is the first object to enable women, by the most thorough
training, practical and scientific, to practise that branch of the art
of medicine which all are agreed should be theirs, <i>not</i> ‘like men’—for
nearly all the best men are agreed how deficient are the
practical training and opportunities of medical students, especially
in midwifery, which deficiency yet does not prevent them
from obtaining diploma, license, all they want, in order to practise—<i>not</i>
‘like men’ then, but like <i>women</i>, like women who wish
to be real physician accoucheuses; that is, to attend and to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>consulted in all deliveries, abnormal as well as normal, in diseases
of women and children, as the best accoucheurs attend and are
consulted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sensible women say, ‘But the only means to obtain a scientific
education <i>is</i> to enter men’s classes.’</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Is</i> that the case?</p>

<p class='c007'>Is the student’s scientific and practical education all that could
be wished?</p>

<p class='c007'>Could there not be given (and <i>is</i> there not given, in some
Continental schools?) a far more thorough and complete scientific
education, as well as practical, where there are none but women, in
a midwifery school, without all this struggle and contest, which
raises questions so disagreeable and ridiculous that a woman of
delicate feeling shuns the indelicacy of the contest—<i>not</i> the indelicacy
of the occupation?</p>

<p class='c007'>The parody, the <i><span lang="la">qui pro quo</span></i>, is a curious one.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indelicacy of a man attending a woman in her lying-in is
by necessity overlooked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The indelicacy of a woman attending with men in medical
classes is made much of.</p>

<p class='c007'>Would it not be far better to get rid of both at once? to have
women—trained with women, by women—to attend women—trained
in all branches of a scientific and practical midwifery
education?</p>

<p class='c007'>But let no one think that real midwifery education can be less
complete and thorough for a woman than it ought to be for a
man, if women are really to be physician accoucheuses.</p>

<p class='c007'>And let no one think that two or three courses of lectures—a
month, three months, six months at a lying-in institution, conducting
twenty, thirty, or one hundred labours—will make a
woman into a (real) midwife.</p>

<p class='c007'>One hundred labours may be normal, requiring no interference
but that which a good midwifery nurse can give. The one hundred
and first may be abnormal and may cost the patient her
life or health, the attendant her reputation and peace, if her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>education has been nothing but the few lectures, the few weeks,
the few labours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us suppose for a moment that, leaving aside the ordinary
talk of giving a woman a ‘man’s medical education,’ good or bad,
we imagine what a college might be to give the whole necessary
training—medical, scientific and practical—to make real midwives,
real physician accoucheuses.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be first, of course, the lying-in institution, the deliveries
conducted by fully qualified head midwives, of whom
enough perhaps exist already for this purpose, who will give practical
instruction to the pupil midwives at the bedside.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must be a staff of professors, to give scientific instruction
in midwifery, but also in anatomy, physiology, and the like; in
pathology and pathological branches; above all, in <i>sanitary</i>
science and practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dissections and post-mortem examinations will have to be
practised. It need not be said that these must be at a quite
different time and place in the ‘course of education’ from the
training about the lying-in patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably all these professors, or nearly all, must at first be
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably in time all these professors, or nearly all, will come to
be women.</p>

<p class='c007'>The course of education, before the end of which no pupil can
receive the certificate of a fully qualified midwife, must certainly
not be less than two years.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Is</i> this merely an ideal? <i>Is</i> it an Utopia? Have we never
seen it in practice? Could it not be put in practice in practical
England?</p>

<p class='c007'>Seen it in practice we have—save and except the <i>sanitary</i>
practice, which is wofully deficient—on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p class='c007'>And lady professors there have been in midwifery on the Continent
quite equal to the most distinguished physician accoucheurs
in this or in any other country; who took their place among these,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>among the Sir James Simpsons and the Sir Charles Lococks, as
<i>of</i> them, and not outside of them, in all midwifery matters, scientific
as well as practical.</p>

<p class='c007'>The names of Madame Boivin and Madame Lachapelle, of Paris,
are known to all Europe. And there are many other names of lady
professors in midwifery and of midwives, not known in England at
all, who take their uncontested places on the continent in practice,
in consultation, in teaching, as a Sir James Simpson here. They
teach in midwives’ colleges, and imperial and royal ladies <i>are</i>
sometimes, and often wish to be always, attended by them.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Note.</i>—A society has already existed for several years, the
object of which, according to its programme, is ‘to provide
educated women with proper facilities for learning the theory
and practice of midwifery, and the accessory branches of medical
science.’</p>

<p class='c007'>The programme states most justly that, for want of these, for
want of ‘proper means of study,’ of ‘any public examination,’
‘any person may undertake the duties of a midwife.’</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us look what the ‘proper means of study’ are which it
provides.</p>

<p class='c007'>They are—1. Attendance upon lectures during two winter
sessions. 2. Attendance ‘during the intervening summer’ upon
clinical practice at ‘<i>a</i>’ lying-in hospital or maternity charity,
with personal attendance upon at least <i>twenty-five</i> deliveries!</p>

<p class='c007'>[It is easy to make a rough calculation how many cases of
abnormal parturition occur to how many normal. Is it likely
that among ‘twenty-five deliveries’ there will be abnormal cases
enough to practise the pupil-judgment, the pupil-hand?]</p>

<p class='c007'>These ladies have not even the advantages which the idlest
student can hardly help availing himself of—and <i>his</i> minimum is
‘three years.’ Yet this is the course proposed to enable a woman
to ‘practise midwifery,’ even in the sense in which we understand
a man to ‘practise midwifery,’—to enable a woman to become a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>physician accoucheuse (for these ladies are expressly styled ‘accoucheuses’)
in the sense in which we understand a man to be a
physician accoucheur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paper states, doubtless with truth, that these ladies ‘are
the best taught accoucheuses hitherto accessible to the English
public.’ May we not hope that, in future years, the society will
be enabled to give ‘accoucheuses’ still better taught ‘to the
English public’?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. The approximate number of deliveries, 6396, given elsewhere, is rather under the mark than
over, as will be seen by this Table, and is taken in order to be on the safe side. For, up to the three last
years, the numbers are rather estimated than reckoned from the records. The total annual average
deliveries calculated from different monthly records, i. e. 10 years of months = 500 in round numbers—1858–1867.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three years 1868–9–70, for which only there are accurate records, speak for themselves; and they
show that the death-rate is marvellously low: not higher than in the healthy districts of England.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. An attempt has been made in certain cases to account for the high death-rates
of lying-in hospitals from the large proportion of unmarried women
admitted. This opinion is directly contradicted by the experience of Liverpool
workhouse, where out of 1,401 deliveries of women, 936 of whom, or two-thirds,
were unmarried, there were only 6 deaths = 4·2 per 1,000 death-rate.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. In Lambeth and St. Pancras the wards are generally full.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. These arrangements are commonly the same in civil lying-in institutions.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. I call a midwife a woman who has received such a training, scientific and
practical, as that she can undertake all cases of parturition, normal and abnormal,
subject only to consultations, like any other accoucheur. Such a training could
not be given in less than two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>I call a midwifery nurse a woman who has received such a training as will
enable her to undertake all normal cases of parturition, and to know when the
case is of that abnormal character that she must call in an accoucheur.</p>

<p class='c007'>No training of six months could enable a woman to be more than a midwifery
nurse.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f21'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r21'>21</a>. In some London workhouses it is yet larger.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. The only difficulty is as to protecting the patient (a lying-in woman)
during the transit in cold or wet weather; but perhaps some cover might be
contrived for the bed or litter on which she is carried, which would be light,
easily removable, and which could be exposed to the free action of the open air
when not in use.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c007'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. For a great part of the foregoing details of management I am indebted to
the valuable experience of her, who, as then Superior of the nursing at King’s
College Hospital, conducted our Training School for Midwifery Nurses there, so
kindly, so wisely, and so well, that its necessary breaking up was the more to
be deplored by all.</p>
